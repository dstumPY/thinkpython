HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS. 



The family name of Dix is of the 

DIX same significance as the name Dicks 
or Dickens, the letter "s" being a 
contraction of "son," meaning the son of Dick 
or of Richard. Dick, the familiar abbrevia- 
tion of Richard, is thought to be derived from 
the Dutch word "Dyck" or "Dijck," a bank 
or dike (also dyke), mound or ditch, of earth, 
sand or stones reinforced, thrown up to pre- 
vent low land in Holland from being inun- 
dated by the sea or river. The reason for 
including the meaning "ditch" in connection 
with "mound" is because in the act of cre- 
ating a barrier, or diking, a ditch is created 
at the selfsame time ; but the intention being 
to create a wall of earth, chief thought is 
therefore directed to that meaning of the 
word. Based accordingly on this idea of the 
significance of the name's derivation, the con- 
clusion cannot be otherwise that this family, 
"before coming over to America, dwelt near a 
■dyke in Holland, in the lowlands as they are 
called, undoubtedly along the coast. 

The name is therefore found in the spellings 
Di.K. Dikx, Diks, Dicks, Dyck, Dyk, Dijck 
and Dyke, and some families in America 
show that they came originally from such a 
locality in Holland by employing the prefix 
"van" or "von," as Van Dyke. 

The Dix coat-of-arms, of the Amsterdam 
"branch, was as follows: D'azur a trotis tetes 
et cols de cygne d'argent, accompagne de 
debx roses d'or en fiancs. That of the Har- 
lem line was as follows : D'or a la fasce 
d'azur, accompagne de trois corneilles de 
sable, souvent ecarteie de gules au chevron, 
accompagne en chef de deux etoiles et en 
pointe d'un croissant tourne, le tout d'or. 
Crest: Une corneille de sable entre un vol 
■d'or et d'azur. 

Four distinct branches of the Dix family 
were started in .America in early times. These 



Watertown, Massachusetts, and the Dix fam- 
ily of Accomac county in Virginia. It is not 
known that anybody has been able to demon- 
strate the relationship reliably. Undoubtedly 
they were connected by the generation just 
previous to any one of them coming to 
America. 

Edward Dix and his wife, Deborah, canie 
from England and settled at Watertown, 
Massachusetts. They were in the fleet with 
Governor Winthrop, in 1630. He appears 
to have died at that place, prior to the re- 
moval of his immediate family into Connecti- 
cut, leaving a widow and three children. The 
widow, Deborah, married (second) October 
16, 1667, Richard Barnes, of Marlboro, 
Massachusetts, by whom she had five chil- 
dren, between 1669 and 1683, according to 
certain published records ; but the dates seem 
somewhat averse to the fact. Children: i. 
Leonard, see forward. 2. John, who was in 
Hartford, Connecticut, in 1676; was taxed 
there in 1683 : sold his house and land in 
1686: owned land in Hoccanum, near the 
mouth of the river bearing that name, in 
1679; joined the Second Church of Hart- 
ford, September 10, 1686: married Mary Bid- 
well ; children : Sarah, John, Margaret, Dan- 
iel, Elizabeth, Susanna and Joseph. 3. Wil-

(H) Leonard, son of Edward and Deborah 
Dix, was known to be in Wethersfield, Con- 
necticut, after which he was in Branford, 
Connecticut, where he receive<l a grant of 
land; soon afterwards was again at "VVethers- 
field, where he also had grants of very good 
land and a lot in the village on which he re- 
sided from about 1650 until the time of his 
death. He was a prominent man of the place, 
constable in 1672, and surveyor of highways 
in 1684. On his death he left considerable 
land on the east side of the Great River, "be-

(IX) John Alden Dix, son of James Law- 
ton and Laura Ann (Stevens) Dix, was born 
at Glens Falls, New York, December 25, 
i860. He studied at the Glens Falls Acad- 
emy, graduating in 1879, and then entered 
Cornell L'niversity, graduating in 1883. He 
began the practical duties of life by working 
first as a farm hand and then in the machine 
shops of his native town, thereby securing a 
valuable experience which benefited him in 
his later career. He then engaged in the 
lumber business with Lemon Thomson, of 
Albany, at Thomson, New York, under the 
firm name of Thomson & Dix. On the death 
of the senior partner, in February, 1897, the 
firm was dissolved, and Mr. Dix was appoint- 
ed executor of his deceased partner's estate. 
He purchased the latter's interest and devel- 
oped a paper mill at Thomson, where his 
chief business is centered, gradually building 
up one of the most efficient wall-paper plants 
in the country, and at the same time turned 
his attention to the conservation of natural 
resources. Mr. Dix realized that much of 
New York's wealth lay in her trees, and to 
protect himself he acquired a tract of seven- 
teen thousand acres for his own mills, and 
made it a rule that for every tree which was 
cut down another should be planted. His 
relations with his workmen have always been 
happy, owing to the fact that he shows some 
consideration for their welfare: his factories 
have always been built with the utmost re- 
gard for hygiene, and he has given his work- 
m.en a half-holiday every week during the 
months of July and August. As a business 
man he is scrupulously honorable in all his 
dealings, bearing a reputation for integrity, 
and as a banker he has achieved the increase 
of the rate which the state earns on its de- 
posits. A stockholder in the Exchange and 
the First National Bank, he brought about 
the amalgamation of the two and became first 
vice-president of the enlarged First National 
Bank. In addition he is serving as president 
of the Iroquois Paper Company, vice-president 
of the Blandy Paper Company, treasurer of 
the American \\'oodboard (Zompany, manager 
of the Moose River Lumber Company, and 
director of the National Bank of Schuylerville. 
In politics Mr. Dix is a Democrat, adher- 
ing to the sound and long-tried principles of 
Democracy of which the Nation has need in 
the direction of its affairs. At the National 



Convention at St. Louis Mr. Dix met and 
became acquainted with many of the leading 
men of the Democratic party. In 1906 he 
was a candidate for the gubernatorial nomina- 
tion at Buffalo, New York; in the fall of 
1908 was placed on the ticket as lieutenant- 
governor; in the spring of 1910 was chosen 
chairman of the state Democratic committee, 
and in the fall of 19 10 became the Demo- 
cratic nominee for governor and was elected. 
His method in discharging the chairmanship 
of the state Democratic committee was the 
method of a man of conscience and right in- 
tentions, seriously desiring to ascertain what 
was best for those who had placed their trust 
in him. He called in conference the leading 
men of his party, and in the summer he made 
a tour by automobile for the purpose of hold- 
ing a series of conferences in as many coun- 
ties as he could visit, to which he invited 
members of every faction with the object of 
coming to a complete understanding of the 
situation. He has inspired his party with a 
new feeling, has put new life into it. and has 
won the respect and confidence of those whom 
he has consulted of the mass of Democratic 
voters. Upon public questions Mr. Dix has 
made declarations which show him to be in 
accord with the principles of the platform 
upon which he stands. He is an advocate of 
an honest revision of the tariff', of a reason- 
able and conservative, not a destructive re- 
vision, of a revision that will strip the un- 
worthy beneficiaries of the protective tariff 
law of privileges of extortion of which no 
men, and least of all they, should have the 
enjoyment, a revision that will, so far as pos- 
sible, tend to reduce the present high cost of 
living. He is an advocate of an economical 
administration of the affairs of the state, and 
of a cutting off of the useless expenditures 
which have so multiplied during the past 
years. Mr. Dix is in the best sense a repre- 
sentative of the intelligent, active, sober-mind- 
ed, conservative and successful citizenship of 
the Empire State. He is a man to whom his 
fellow-citizens would readily turn for coun- 
sel, to whom they would with confidence in- 
trust the conduct of affairs demanding fore- 
sight, sound judgment, ability and uprightness. 
He was one of the founders of the Democratic 
League and as such stands for personal free- 
dom. National and .State economy, the re- 
vision of the tariff and revenue laws, and the 
abolition of protection for gigantic "infant in- 
dustries." 

Mr. Dix is a warden of St. Stephen's Epis- 
copal Church of Schuylerville, and a member 
of Glens Falls Lodge, Free and Accepted 
Masons, Theta Delta Chi fraternity, Albany

(The Winslow Line). 

The English ancestry of Governor Edward 
Winslow, from whom the Crannell family of 
Albany descend through maternal lines, is 
traced in this review to about the middle of 
the fourteenth century. 

(I) William Winslow, or Wyncelow, the 
first of the lineage as traced in England, had 
two sons : John, of London, afterward of 
Wyncelow Hall, married Mary Crouchman, 
who died in 1409; William (2), see forward. 

(H) William (2), son of William (i) 
Winslow, married and had issue. 

(HI) Thomas, son of William (2) Wins- 
low, was of Burton county, Oxford, having 
lands also in Essex, where he was living in 
1452. He married Cecelia Tansley, one of 
two daughters and an heiress. She was 
called "Lady Agnes." 

(IV) William (3), son of Thomas and Ce- 
celia (Tansley) Winslow, was living in 1529. 
Children: Kenelm, see forward, and Rich- 
ard, who had a grant from Edward VI. of the 
rectory of Elksley, county of Nottingham. 

(V) Kenelm, son of William (3) Wins- 
low, purchased in 1559 of Sir Richard New- 
port an estate called "Newport's Place," in 
Kempsey, Worcestershire. He had another 
and an older extensive estate in the same 
parish, called "Clerkenleap." He died in 1607 
in the parish of St. Andrew. He married 

Catherine . His will, dated April 14, 

1607, is still preserved in Worcester. Child, 
Edward, see forward. 

(VI) Edward, only son of Kenelm and 
Catherine Winslow, was born in the parish of 
St. Andrew, county Worcester, England, Oc- 
tober 17, 1560, died before 1651. He lived 
in Kempsey and Droitwich, county Worces- 
ter. He married (first) Eleanor Pelham, of 
Droitwich; (second) at St. Bride's church, 
London, November 4, 1594. Magdalene Oli- 
ver, the records of whose family are found 
in the parish register of St. Peter's, Droit- 
wich. Children: i. Richard, married Alice 
Hay, daughter of Edward Hurdman ; re- 
mained in England. 2. Edward (2), see for- 
ward. 3. John, born in England, 1597, died 
in Boston, Massachusetts; married, 1624, 
Mary, daughter of James and Susanna Chil-

ton. 4. Kenelm, born in Droitwich, 1599, 
came to America about 1629. He was an im- 
portant man in the Plymouth Colony, filled 
various town offices, and was deputy to the 
general court eight years. He married 
Eleanor Adams, widow of John .A.dams of 
Plymouth, and is the immigrant ancestor of a 
long line of descendants. 5. Gilbert, born 
October 26, 1600, in Droitwich, England, 
•came to America in the "Mayflower" with 
his brother. Governor Edward Winslow, 
signed the "Compact," returned to England 
after 1623, where he died. 6. Eleanor, re- 
mained in England. 7. Josiah, born in Eng- 
land, was sent to America in 163 1 as ac- 
countant to William Shirley; lived at Marsh- 
field. Massachusetts : married, 1636, Mar- 
garet Bourne, died December i, 1674. 8. 
Elizabeth, remained in England. 9. Magda- 
len, remained in England. 

(VH) Governor Edward (2), eldest son 
of Edward (i) and his second wife Magda- 
lene (Oliver) Winslow, was born October 
18, 1595, at Droitwich, England, died and 
was buried at sea, ]\Iay 8, 1655, with the 
honors of war, forty-two guns being fired 
by the fleet that he was accompanying from 
Hispaniola to Jamaica, West Indies. After 
Governor Bradford and Edward Brewster, 
Plymouth Colony owed no man so much as 
Edward Winslow. Always intelligent, gener- 
ous, confident and of untiring energy, he was 
trusted for any service, at home or abroad, 
which the necessities of the infant colony 
happened to require. Were the North East- 
ern fisherman to be sought for a supply of 
food in a famine, or the Indian chief needed 
watching, or the governor's place to be taken 
temporarily, or ^^lassachusetts dissuaded from 
an act of too-severe austerity, or finally were 
the rulers in England to be made propitious, 
the natural resort was to the agency of Ed- 
ward Winslow. For foreign employment 
his gentle birth and breeding gave him an ad- 
vantage, and among the gentlemen of the Bri- 
tish parliament he moved as one of them- 
selves. He was highly esteemed by Gover- 
nors Winthrop and Bradford, while the great 
Protector Cromwell saw at once the worth of 
the honest, religious, capable, strenuous en- 
voy from North America, and took care never 
to lose his services while he lived, which was 
for nine years after he finally left Plymouth. 
At the time of his death he was superintend- 
ing the attempt upon Santo Domingo under 
Cromwell's appointment, and distress at the 
failure, through military mismanagement, is 
believed to have brought on his last illness. 
He met at Leyden, Holland, his first wife, 
Elizabeth Barker, of English birth and edu- 



cation. They were married in Leyden, and 
together came in the "Mayflower" to Amer- 
ica. He was the third signer of the immortal 
"Compact," and probably was one of the 
authors. His wife died during the first win- 
ter. William White, one of the chief men 
of the colony, died, leaving a widow, Su- 
sanna (Fuller) White, with two little boys to 
care for, one of them Peregrine White, who 
was born while the "Mayflower" was lying 
at Cape Cod, the first English child born in 
New England. Edward Winslow married 
the widow, and theirs was the first wedding 
ceremony performed in the new colony. They 
were married before the magistrate. Gover- 
nor Bradford, and with public solemnities en- 
tered into the covenant of marriage. At the 
annual election in 1624 he was chosen assist- 
ant to the governor, holding by successive 
appointments until 1647, excepting 1633, 
1636 and 1644, when he was chosen governor. 
In these and many other public trusts he ac- 
quitted himself with distinguished ability and 
credit. He was also the author of several 
valuable works relating to the interests of the 
colony. He made several trips to England 
in the colony's interest and in 1635 was ar- 
rested and tried on the charge "that not being 
in holy orders, he had taught publicly in the 
church and had officiated at marriages," to 
which he could only plead that he had spoken 
in the churches and in the capacity of magis- 
trate performed the marriage ceremony. For 
this honest avowal he was pronounced guilty 
of the crime charged by the archbishop, com- 
mitted to the Fleet prison, where he was kept 
in confinement seventeen weeks. He was 
chosen governor for the last time in 1644, and 
subsequently was first on the list of magis- 
trates. He was soon after engaged in the 
English public service abroad, and never re- 
turned to New England. By his second wife, 
Susanna (Fuller) White, to whom he 
was married May 12, 162 1, he had a 
daughter Elizabeth, who married Gilbert 
Brooks, of Scituate. His only son was Josiah, 
see forward. 

(VIII) Josiah, son of Governor Edward 
(2) and his second wife, Susanna (Fuller- 
White) Winslow, was born in Plymouth, 
1629, died in Marshfield, Massachusetts, De- 
cember 18, 1680. In 1657, two years after 
the death of his father, he was chosen assist- 
ant governor, which post he filled until his 
election as governor in 1673. This last office 
he held until his death. He was active and 
prominent in colony affairs all his mature life. 
In 1652 he commanded the military company 
of Marshfield; in 1659 he was appointed mili- 
tary commander of the colony, and in 1675 



r4i6 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



was elected general-in-chief of the whole mili- 
tary force of the United Colonies, being the 
first native-born general, as well as governor 
in New England. In 1658 he was chosen one 
of the commissioners of the United Colonies 
and re-elected for fourteen years. On Sep- 
tember 5, 1672, he was one of the six signers 
of the new articles of confederation of the 
New England colonies, and on September 9. 
1675, he signed the declaration of war against 
King Philip, made by the commissioners. 
While he was governor in 1674-75. the first 
public school in the colony was established, 
and in 1680 the first lieutenant-governor was 
elected. The general court ordered in 1675 
that four halberdiers should attend the gover- 
nor and magistrates at elections, and two dur- 
ing the court sessions. Under him the gov- 
ernment maintained a state hitherto unknown 
in the colony. He resided at "Careswell," 
the family seat at Marshfield, and enjoyed the 
distinction of being the most accomplished 
gentleman in the colony. When first a com- 
missioner in 1658, he refused to sanction the 
"horrible recommendation" of that year 
against the Quakers. His capture of Alexan- 
der in 1662, the brother of Philip, and for 
two years sachem after Massasoit's death, 
illustrates his courage and personal daring as 
a soldier. His last public act on September 
5, 1680, was to solicit a charter for Plymouth 
from the crown. He married, in 1658, Pene- 
lope, daughter of Herbert Pelham, of Eng- 
land, who came to Boston in 1645. He was 
the first treasurer of Harvard college, and 
assistant governor in 1646-1649. There were 
four children born of this marriage, two sons 
and two daughters; only one of his sons, 
Isaac, survived childhood. He married Sarah, 
daughter of John and Elizabeth Paddy Wens- 
ley, of Boston. One of the daughters, Molly, 
married Robert Crannell, and they were the 
progenitors of the Albany family of that name 
(see Crannell I). Another daughter, Eliza- 
beth, married Stephen Burton. There is no 
one bearing the name of Winslow who can 
claim lineal descent fl-om Governor Edward 
Winslow, third signer of the "Compact" and 
third governor of New Plymouth, the first 
by elective voice of the people. "Careswell," 
the coimtry seat of Governor Josiah Winslow. 
subsequently became the residence of Daniel 
Webster. Governor Josiah's portrait and that 
of his wife hang in Plymouth Hall, Plymouth, 
Massachusetts. She is said to have been a 
most beautiful and accomplished lady. The 
coat-of-arms of the Winslow family is a tree 
with its branches cut down into a knight's hel- 
met. Motto: "Floreo decarpius," ("Though 
plucked, I flourish.") 



The Sherman family is of 
SHERMAN German origin. The name 
was spelled S h e r r m a n, 
Schurman, Schearmaun and Scherman. As 
early as 1635 the family was located in Eng- 
land, in Dedham, county Essex. The name is 
derived from the original occupation of the 
family, when they were cloth dressers, or 
"shearers" of the cloth, and the family at 
Dedham continued the family occupation. In 
New England there are two distinct families 
of this name. One is descended from William 
Sherman and the other from Henry Sherman. 
The arms of the Yaxley family are : Or a 
lion rampant sable charged on the shoulder 
with an amulet for difference between three 
oak leaves vert. Crest : A sea lion sejeant 
argent guttee de poix fumed or.

Chloe, August 4, 1765. Child of second wife : 
Ware Darwin, mentioned below. 

(X) Ware Darwin, son of John (4) Sher- 
man, was born at Conway, Massachuetts, Oc- 
tober 3, 1 77 1, died about 1842. When a young 
man he removed to Arlington, Vermont, prob- 
ably as early as 1790, and he married there 
Anna D. Canfield, of Arlington, daughter of 
Ezekiel and Mary (Sackett) Canfield. They 
settled at Kingsbury, New York, about 1806, 
and subsequently removed to Luzerne. He 
Avas a farmer and lumberman. Children : 
John Sackett, born 1790; Lydia, 1792; Rich- 
ard. 1795; Augustus, mentioned below; Abi- 
gail, 1807; Anson, 1808: Avery, 1810: Anna, 
1813. 

(XI) Augustus, son of Ware Darwin Sher- 
man, was born in Arlington, \'ermont, Feb- 
ruary II, 1801, died December 3, 1884. When 
he was five years old his parents went to 
Kingsbury, and shortly afterward to Fairfield, 
now Luzerne, New York. About 1823 the 
family migrated to Pennsylvania, going in a 
covered wagon, and covering a distance of 
forty miles in a day between Schenectady and 
Buffalo, New York, they claiming to have 
the fastest team in the State. Augustus Sher- 
man attended the winter terms of the common 
school, but the schools were crude and the 
terms short. Early in life he became familiar 
with the hard work of the farmer and lum- 
berman. Before the Glens Falls feeder was 
constructed he used to draw lumber across 
from Corinth or Big Falls, raft it on cribs to 
the bend and thence take it across Deadman's 
I'oint above Fort Edward, and after the big 
dam at that place was built he had to carry 
the timber still farther down the river to 
Rogers's landing opposite Schuyler's Island, 
whence it was rafted to market. With the 
■opening of the Glens Falls feeder he was 
among the first to place a boat on its waters 
for the transportation of lumber. When he 
was but fifteen years old he had to drive a 
lumber wagon alone to .Albany and attend to 
sales and purchases, a task he performed with 
all the good judgment and faithfulness of a 
man of experience. In the following year, in 
consequence of his father's financial troubles, 
he was obliged to take entire charge of the 
business, and he worked early and late with 
untiring perseverance and energy in order to 
help his father out of debt. His venture in 
the lumber business on his own account was 
in operating an old English saw mill with 
two saws, located on a small stream which 
empties into the Hudson river, and at the 
same time he operated a grist mill in tiie vicin- 
ity. In addition to this laborious task, he 
<irew and rafted his lumber to the market. 



Here he laid the foundation of the large 
fortune that he subsequently accumulated. 
After three years he took the Buttolph mill 
farther down the river. Having disposed of 
his property in Luzerne, in the winter of 
1840-41, he made his home near the feeder- 
dam and resumed the manufacture of lumber 
on a large scale with greatly increased facili- 
ties. Two years later lie went to Glens Falls, 
where he made a permanent home. Year by 
year, with increased means at his command, 
his lumber operations became more and more 
extended until they reached colossal propor- 
tions. He began to invest heavily in lumber 
lands by purchasing in the sixteenth township 
and he secured prompt and substantial profits. 
He had the thorough knowledge of business 
and values, and uncommon shrewdness in 
buying and selling. All his investments 
turned out well, and his fortune became in 
the end second to none in the county. His 
career was a notable example of the Ameri- 
can self-made business man. He was asso- 
ciated with nearly all the financial corpora- 
tions of Glens Falls, either as trustee, direc- 
tor, manager or president. He was the first 
president of the Glens Falls Paper Mill Com- 
pany and also of the Bald Mountain Lime 
Company. In the early seventies he interested 
himself in erecting handsome business build- 
ings in Glens Falls. In politics he was a Re- 
publican, and in religion a Presbyterian. He

The earliest record of the- 
OSTROM name, which is of good old 

Holland Dutch origin, was one 
Gerret Willemese Oesteroem (notice the 
spelling, which is one of the most peculiar 
and puzzling of the Dutch characteristics), 
who came to this country and settled in Bev- 
erwyck (Albany), 1631, but all record of 
his descendants is lost. Hendrick Janse Oes- 
teroem, of Bushwick (Flatbush), Long 
Island, 1660. had descendants who went to- 
Bergen, New Jer.sey. and thence up the Hud- 
son river to Kingston, I'ouglikeopsie and else- 
where. An Ostrom in the Netherlands pos- 
sessed a coat-of-arms. They were banished" 
from Holland on account of their religion.

The Scott family of Saratoga 
SCOTT Springs, New York, descend 

from an English ancestor, Ben- 
jamin Scott, who settled in Ireland in the 
reign of James I. 

(I) George Scott, born in Londonderry 
county, Ireland, came to the American colo- 
nies in 1773 and located on a farm in the 
town of Ballston, Saratoga county. New 
York, near the Milton line, on the "Middle 
Line Road." This was then but a clearing 
in the great northern wilderness, and the in- 
habitants were in a state of constant watch- 
fulness against the wild things of the forest. 
The danger from the Indians was very great, 
and in October, 1780, a band of Tories and 
Indians, under the leadership of Captain 
Munro, attacked the Scott homestead, which 
they pillaged and left the owner supposedly 
dead from a blow on the head from a toma- 
hawk. It was during this raid that General 
James Gordon and almost every settler along 
the "Middle Line," was captured and taken 
to Canada, some being killed. George Scott 
married a sister of General Gordon. She 
was born and married in Kilcaid county, An- 
trim, Ireland, and was of Scotch ancestors on 
both sides. Her brother, General Gordon, 
born October 31, 1739, came to America when 
a boy of seventeen, went back to Ireland, then 
came again to America, and after being in 
the Indian trade at Albany and army con- 
tracting, settled in Ballston in 1771-72. He 
was active in the revolutionary service, and 
was promoted through successive rank to that 
of brigadier-general by Governor Clinton in 
1785. On October 3, 1780, he arrived at his 
home in Ballston from Poughkeepsie, where 
he had been attending an extra session con- 
vened by Governor Clinton. Some of the 
Tories in the neighborhood informed Munro, 
and the raid was made for the purpose of 
capturing the general. He was awakened by 
bayonets being thrust through the windows 
of his home. After his capture the mau- 
rauders went to the house of George Scott, 
who was felled by the blows from three toma- 
hawks. The Indians rushed forward to take 
his scalp, but were prevented. General Gor- 
don was carried to Quebec, thence to the 
Isle of Orleans, from whence he escaped with 
some of his old neighbors taken in the second 
raid of 1781. He was a large land owner and 
erected mills in Ballston. It was through his 
efforts that his brother-in-law, George Scott, 
located in that section. He married, March.

The name Silliman, Sille- 
SILLLM.AN mant or Sillivant is derived 
from a silly man not silly or 
witless, as useil in modern times, but inno- 
cent, free from guile, a good man. About 
1690 the name came to be spelled Silliman. 
It has been suggested by persons familiar 
with the pronunciation of family names that 
this family was of Irish extraction, but there 
has been no proof yet found. 

(I) Daniel Silliman was in Fairfield in 
1658. He married (first), in July, 1661, Peac-

able Eggleston, widow of John Eggleston.

trator of John Eggleston's estate, ten acres of

ichy or Hannah Hendrickson, widow of 
••Hendrick" or "Henry Hendrickson." He 
was one of the land dividend holders of the 
town. He died intestate in 1690, and the in- 
ventory of his estate, valued at three hundred 
and two pounds, was made January 13, 1690- 
91. His property was divided between his 
wife Hannah and his three sons. It has not 
been determined whether he was related to 
Daniel Sillivant or Selevant. of New Haven, 
who married, before 1654, Abigail Cole, only 
daughter of 'James Cole, of Hartford, and 
who married, October 17. 1654, Eliza Lam- 
berton, daughter of Captain George Lamber- 
ton. master of the famous phantom ship, or 
the ship in the air, lost in 1646. In the New 
Haven records, it says that a William Trow- 
bridge married, March 9, 1667, at Milford, 
Elizabeth, widow of Sillivant and daughter 
of George Lamberton, but before this Eliza- 
beth deeded the house and lands given to her 
husband and his former wife, Abigail, by 
James Cole, her father, in his will, and it 
also says that the said Daniel died in Vir- 
ginia in 1655, and he left a will, proved June 
1655, naming his widow. Tradition says that 
Daniel of Fairfield was from Holland. Chil- 
dren by first wife: Daniel, Thomas, Robert,

great-granddaughter of Thomas Cooke. Sam- 
uel Cooke was born November 22, 1687. and 
became a Congregational minister: settled in

a salary of a hundred pounds a year with his 
firewood. He is described as of dignified ap- 
pearance and manner, wearing a particularly 
careful ministerial dress. He married Anne 
Trowbridge, a girl of twenty, only daughter 
of John Trowbridge, of New Haven. For 
a time Cooke was the principal of the Hop- 
kins grammar school. The wife of John 
Trowbridge was a daughter of GoveVnor 
Leete, a distinguished member of an old Eng- 
lish noble family. Anne was the youngest 
child of seven. Robert Silliman moved to 
New Canaan, Connecticut, to succeed Rev. 
John Eells, as pastor, and continued there for 
thirty years. He accepted a call to Say- 
brook, Connecticut, January 8, 1772. Solomon 
A. Silliman has in his possession a copy of 
the old church record of Saybrook, which 
contains the proceedings of a meeting of the 
society to give a call to Rev. Robert Silliman. 
and his letter of acceptance. It was voted 
at this meeting to give him a salary of sixty 
pounds and twenty cords of firewood a year, 
the sixty pounds to be one-third in cash, and 
two-thirds in food products at the market 
price in that town. His wife died two years 
and a half before him. His own death came 
unexpectedly while he was visiting. Among 
his children were: i. Samuel Cooke, died

navigated the Connecticut river propelled 
by any power but the wind, namely horse- 
power; he loaded it with grain to go up and 
down the river, and, running against a 
"snag," it sank. He afterward left that part 
of the country and moved to a place north of 
Troy, called Half i\Ioon, and from him have 
come three or four generations who have lived 
along the Hudson in this vicinity, some of 
whom have been prominent business men in 
Troy; one each of the third and fourth gen- 
erations are still living here, also some in 
West Troy, now called Watervliet. In the 
census of 1790, the only heads of families of 
this surname at Stamford and Norwalk. 
which are reported together, were Dr. Jo- 
seph, who had two sons under sixteen, and 
three females, and Samuel Cooke, who liad 
one son under sixteen and one female.

Randolph, son of Ingel'ram or 

INGRAM Ing'ram, was the sheriflf of 

Nottingham and Derby in the 

reign of Henry II, 1133-89. He had two 

sons, Robert and William. 

Robert Ingram, knight, son of Randolph, 
was of such importance in the reign of Henry 
III that the Prior and Convent of Lenton 
granted to him a yearly rent out of their 
lands in Sheynton and Nottingham, in recog- 
nition of his military service in their defense. 
His arms are painted in Temple Nevvsham, 
or Newsam, England, which is an immense 
estate, six miles long and four wide, about 
four and a half miles east of Leeds. It is now 
called the Ingram Estate, and at first it was a 
settlement of Knights Templar in the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries. After their disper- 
sion, it was granted by Edward III to Sir 
John Darcy, and descended to Sir Thomas 
Darcy, who was beheaded by Henry VIII, 
and the estate was forfeited to the crown. 
In 1354 it was again granted by Henry Ylll 
to Mathew, Earl of Lennox, and here was 
born his .son, Henry Darnley, who later mar- 
ried Mary, Queen of Scots. The estate de- 
scended to their son, James I, of England, 
and from him to his kinsman, Esme Stuart, 
Duke of Lennox, from whom it passed to 
Sir Arthur Ingram, the first of the Lords 
Viscount Irwin, one of the conditions being 
that the room in which Lord Darnley was 
born in should remain unaltered, and this 
room is still called the "King's Chamber."

Sir Arthur Iiitjram, who is supposed to 
have been born about 1570, was celebrated 
for his valor as a cavalier. He was a near 
relative of Wentworth, the celebrated Earl 
of Stafford. He was twice married ; first to 
Eleanor, daughter of Sir Henry Slingsby, of 
the "Red House," and second to Lady Kath- 
erine, daughter of Thomas, Lord Viscount 
Fairfax of Gilling. Sir Arthur died in 1655. 
His portrait in cavalier costume, that of the 
First Viscount Irwin in full armor, and of 
Henr>', the second Viscount Irwin in half ar- 
mor, all nearly full length, were in the col- 
lection of the Bishop of California, William 
Ingraham Kip, D. D., LL. D., who died in 
1894. His children were Henry and Arthur. 
Henry, son of Sir Arthur Ingram, was 
born between 1595 and 1600. At the time of 
the restoration, six years after the death of 
his father, he was created a peer of Scot- 
land by Charles II, with the title of Viscount 
Irwin, by letters patent, dated May 23, 1661, 
as a recompense to the family for their loy- 
alty. He married Anne, daughter of Mon- 
tacute. Earl of Manchester, a leader in par- 
liament. The male branch in England, as 
descended from Sir Henry, the second Vis- 
count Irwin, became extinct with Charles 
Ingram, ninth Viscount Irwin, who died in 
1778. His daughter, the Marchioness of 
Hertford, and Lady William Gordon, suc- 
cessively inherited Temple Newsam, and from 
them it passed to their sister, Mrs. Hugo 
Maynell, whose son took the name of In- 
gram, and his descendants are the present 
owners of the family estate. 

Arthur, of P.arrowby, son of Sir Arthur 
Ingram, and brother to Henry Ingram, was 
born between 1595 and 1600. He married a 
daughter of Sir John Mallory about 161 5. and 
genealogists agree that it was from him that 
the Ingram family in America is descended. 
(I) Richard, dovibtless son of Arthur In- 
gram, came to America between 1638 and 
1642. He settled in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, 
where he was a proprietor in 1645. Some 
years later he moved to Northampton, Massa- 
chusetts, where in 1668, late in life, he mar- 
ried, probably his second marriage, Joan 
Rockwell Raker, daughter of William Rock- 
well and widow of Jeffrey Raker, of Wind- 
sor, Connecticut. He contributed a sum at 
the time of the general sul)scription for the 
support for Harvard college in 1672-73. He 
died in August, 1683, and his widow died 
September 16. 1683, both at Northampton. 
He is thought to have been a brother of 
Jared and Edward Ingram, as they all lived 
near together at times, and the name is the 
same. F.dward came to America in 1635, and 



Richard between 1638 and 1642, and Jared 
in 1635. There is also a John Ingram, who 
settled at Roston and Hadley, who is thought 
to have been Richard's son. 

(II) John, very likely son of Richard In- 
gram, was born in England about 1642. He 
come to New England when a young man, 
and settled first at Roston, Massachusetts. 
He removed to Hadley, Massachusetts, with 
two others in 1661, and was admitted a free- 
man in 1663. He was a member of Joseph 
Kellogg's company of Hadley, under Captain 
William Turner, and was engaged in the fight 
at Turner's Falls, during King Philip's war. 
May ig, 1676. He died June 22, 1722. He 
married, 1664, Elizabeth, daughter of Sam- 
uel and Elizabeth Gardner, of Hadley, and 
she died November 29, 1684. Children:

Captain Richard Bracket!

name in America. It is 

known that he was in the colony of Massa- 



'430 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



cluisetts Bay as early as 1630. Other Brack- 
etts in the Bay Colony at an early date were 
Peter Brackett, of Boston, and Thomas 
Brackett, of Salem. Captain Richard Brack- 
ett testified by affidavit on July 2, 1668, that 
the year of his birth was 1612. His tomb- 
stone says "aged 80 years," deceased March 
5, 1690. If this be so, he was born in t6io, 
which would make him nineteen years of age 
in 1629, the year he came to America. On 
August 27, 1630, he was among the colonists 
with whom Governor Winthrop organized the 
first church of Boston. With this church he 
remained twelve years, when he removed to 
Braintree. He was made a freeman of Bos- 
ton, 1636, and November 23, 1636, he be- 
came a member of the Ancient and Honor- 
able Artillery Company. While in Boston 
he was appointed by the general court keeper 
of the prison, and was jailer for several years. 
It is stated that the jailer described in Haw- 
thorne's "Scarlet Letter" was Richard Brack- 
ett. Captain Richard Brackett was one of 
the early settlers and incorporators of Brain- 
tree. He sold his Boston property and re- 
moved to Braintree in 1641-42. He was or- 
dained deacon of the Braintree church. July 
21, 1642, and this office he held until his 
death. He was the first town clerk and held 
office several years. In 1652-70-72 he was 
selectman; in 1654 he was elected represen- 
tative to the general court : was also deputy 
in 1655-66-67-71-72-73-74-75-80. He was 
sergeant of the train band, lieutenant, and 
about 1654 was attacked by the Indians dur- 
ing King Philip's war; Captain Richard 
Brackett and his men were constantly em- 
ployed in that war, but there is little record 
of their doings. As he advanced in years he 
sought to unburden himself of some of his 
public duties. In 1684 the general court al- 
lowed him to resign liis place as "chief mili- 
tary commander" of Braintree, after forty- 
three years of service, and thirty as captain. 
His business in Braintree was farming ; he 
had choice of the best land in the town, and 
acquired a considerable estate. When Bille- 
rica, Massachusetts, was incorporated, he be- 
came a freeholder; two of his sons and two 
daughters later settled there. It is said that 
at one time he taught the Braintree school. 
He was a busy man, highly honored and re- 
spected. He is buried in "the north precinct 
of Braintree, now Quincy. 

His wife's name was Alice . She 

was his lifelong companion after their mar- 
riage, she preceeding him to the grave but one 
year, in 1689. A silver cup inscribed B 
used in the Unitarian church in R and A 
i'.raintrce (in -early days Congregational) at 



communion service is the gift of Captain 
Richard Brackett and his wife Alice to the 
church. He made his will January 29, 1689, 
remembered all his children, and nominated 
his son James to be sole executor. The will 
was approved at Boston, December 19, 1690. 
Children: i. Hannah, killed by the Indians at 
Dunstable, now Nashua, New Hampshire; 
married (first) Samuel Kingsley; (second) 
Deacon John Blanchard. 2. John, married 
(first) Hannali French; (second) Mrs. Ruth 
(Morse) Ellis. 3. Peter, twin with John, 
married (first) Elizabeth Bosworth ; (second)

ried Simon Crosby. 5. Mary, married Jo- 
seph, son of Rev. William Thompson. 6. 
James, see forward. 7. Sarah, married Jo- 
seph Crosby. 8. Josiah, married Elizabeth 
Waldo. All of these reared families, some of 
them very large ones. 

{ H) James, son of Captain Richard and 
Alice Brackett, was born in Braintree, Mas- 
sachusetts, about 1645. In deeds he is de- 
scribed as a "Cooper." In 1673 he removed 
to Boston, as shown by his letter of dismissal 
from the Braintree church to the Third (Old 
South) Church in Boston, where he was ad- 
mitted a member, March 2, 1673. In 1682 he 
returned to Braintree, according to similar 
evidence. He was admitted a freeman in 
Boston, May 12, 1675: clerk. 1689-94; was 
sergeant of the Braintree military company, 
1695 ; selectman, 1701-03. He seems to have 
bought and sold a good deal of land and to 
have been a man of some distinction. He 
married, in Braintree, about 1674, Sarah, 
born in Hingham, Massachusetts, December 
22, 1649, died October 6, 1727. daughter of 
Thomas and Sarah (Beal) Alarsh, and grand-

until his death, in May, 1743. He led the 
quiet life of a farmer, and never held public 
office. In 1723 he was chosen constable, but 
prevailed upon his brother-in-law to accept 
the office in his stead, the selectmen giving

In 1872 he was graduated from 'Cornell Col- 



1432 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



lege, a Methodist institution of learning at 
Mount Vernon. In September, 1872, he lo- 
cated in Saratoga Springs, New York, where 
he began the study of law in the office of Pond 
& French. In June, 1875, he was admitted to 
the New York bar, at the general term of the 
supreme court held at Elmira, and the same 
month his Alma Mater conferred upon him 
the degree of A.M. In the spring of 1876 
he became the junior member of the law firm 
of Pond, French & Brackett, continuing this 
association for twelve years, when the firm be- 
came Pond & Brackett. He became the senior 
member of Brackett, Butler & Baucus; since 
1891 he has practised his profession alone. 
He is a very able and successful practitioner, 
learned in the law, skillful in its application, 
wise and safe as a counselor. His advice and 
assistance is often sought by his legal breth- 
ren in the trial of cases, or in argument before 
appellate tribunals. In the year 1895 he began 
his public political career that continues to the 
present time (1910). In that year he was 
elected state senator from the district, com- 
posed of Saratoga, Schenectady and Wash- 
ington counties. He at once took prominent 
rank in the councils of his party (RepubH- 
can) and in the work of the senate. He has 
been in continuous service in the senate 
through successive re-elections, except the 
years 1907-08. His course as a legislator has 
met with the approval of his district, and has 
attracted a great amount of favorable com- 
ment outside district and state. He is inde- 
pendent in thought and action, and neither 
threats nor promises have induced him to 
swerve from his privately formed opinion. 
The undue promotion of private interests at 
the expense of the people has always had in 
him a vigorous opponent. To no one man 
is more credit due for recent legislation in 
regard to the control of insurance and other 
companies than to the fearless, upright Sen- 
ator Brackett. In 1898 he received a further 
evidence of the high esteem in which he is 
held by his "Alma Mater" by the conferring 
upon him of the degree LL.D. He has always 
taken a great interest in educational matters, 
has served for several years upon the com- 
mittee of public education, and most gener- 
ously aided Cornell College with his influence 
and financial aid. His business interests be- 
yond law and politics are largely in Saratoga 
Springs. He is president of the Adirondack 
Trust Company and other of the village's en- 
terprises. He finds relaxation at the Saratoga 
Club, of which he is a member. He belongs 
to Rising Sun Lodge, No. 103, Free and Ac- 
cepted Masons, Chapter and Washington 
Commandery. Senator Brackett's deepest in- 



terest is in the law. Valuable as his services 
have been to the state as a legislator, and 
apparently deeply engrossed in public affairs 
as he is, it is to the law that he has given 
his life's best thought and most earnest ef- 
fort, and it is as a lawyer that he prefers to 
go down in history. Still in the vigor of his 
manhood, he is actively engaged in his pro- 
fession, ranking with the most eminent in 
the state. He married, November 22, 1882, 
Mary Emma, daughter of Charles and Anna 
(Laing) Corliss. Children: Edgar Truman, 
Jr., born March 25, 1890, died July 10, 1899; 
"Charles William, November 26, 1892. 



The house of Argyll, head 
CAMPBELL of the Scottish Clan Camp- 
bell, have an authenticated 
history extending back to the great Diarmid 
'Mac Dwibhne, who was contemporary with the 
79th King of Scots, Anno Domini, 977. From 
him through lyric odes of the bards and tra- 
dition they trace thirteen generations further 
back into antiquity to Constantine, who came 
over from France in the year 404 and died 
Anno Domini, 420. In the seventeenth gen- 
eration from Constantine the whole clan 
O'Dwibhne in Argyllshire assumed the sur- 
name Campbell in courtesy to their chief, Ar- 
chibald, whose name or title was translated in 
the Latin Campus Bellus, and Campbell the 
name has since been. The family were noble 
for ten generations to Archibald, the tenth 
earl, who in 1701 was created by William the 
Third, Duke of Argyle. He was of the for- 
tieth generation. The present Duke of Argyle 
is the thirty-first Campbell in direct descent 
to hold the title. 

The first of the clan to come to America and 
settle in northern New York was Captain 
Laughlin Campbell, a soldier of great courage, 
who visited Washington county in 1737 in 
response to the invitation of the New York 
authorities to Scotch Highlanders to settle 
here. Laughlin Campbell was a younger 
brother of the then Duke of Argyle. Being 
pleased with the country, he was promised a 
grant of thirty thousand acres for colony use, 
for survey fees and quit rent, by Lieutenant- 
Governor Clark. He returned to Scotland, 
sold his property, raised a colony of four hun- 
dred and twenty-three adults, and with a part 
of them came the next year (1738) to New 
York, where Governor Clark insisted on full 
fees and a share in the land. Campbell re- 
fused his demands, and Clark recommended 
the legislature to grant the colony assistance, 
but that body, then at war with the governor, 
declined to respond, as they suspected the 
money would go to the colonial officials for 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



fees. The colonists were obliged to separate 
to earn their living, and Campbell, with the 
remains of his broken fortunes, purchased and 
settled down upon a small farm in the prov- 
ince. A few years after, in 1745, when the 
rebellion broke out in Scotland, he went back 
to that country and served under the Duke of 
Cumberland until the close of the war. He 
then returned to his family here, and died 
soon after from the effects of wounds received 
in the war. His children were afterward 
granted, in 1763, a tract of ten thousand acres 
in Washington county, in the town of Argyle, 
now Greenwich. 

(H) Duncan, son of Captain Laughlin 
Campbell, settled in the town of Argyle, 
Washington county, New York, on the "Camp- 
bell Patent," near the Batten Kill, in 1765. In 
1803 the town of Greenwich was created from 
Argyle and his farm was in the new town. 
It contained four hundred and fifty acres. 
From 1772 to 1780 Duncan Campbell was 
supervisor of the town. He married and had 
.issue. In the old burying ground at. Fort 
Edward, New York, may be seen an old tomb- 
stone, which must not be confounded with the 
burial place of Duncan Campbell, although he 
was a kinsman. "Here lyes the body of Dun- 
can Campbell of Invershaw Esq. Major to the 
old Highland regiment ; aged 55 years who 
died the 17th of July 1758 of the wounds he 
received in the attack of the Retrenchments of 
Ticonderoga or Carillon 8th of July 1758." 

(HI) Archibald, son of Duncan Campbell, 
was born on the farm in Argyle in 1739, died 
at Jackson, New York, January 31, 1808. He 
was a merchant, and one of the five trustees 
appointed to divide and distribute the land to 
the grantees under the Campbell patent. In 
1772-73-74 he was town clerk. In 1789 his 
name heads the list of subscribers to the fund 
for erecting a church building for the United 
Presbyterian congregation, of which he was 
one of the original members. He married 
Flora McNeil, born 1755, died in Jackson, 
New York, November i, 1825. They are

(The Smith Line). 

The family line of Katherine E. Smith 
(Mrs. Jackson A. Sumner) was founded in 
America by Johannes Schmidt, of Germany, 
son of Ludwig. Smith's "History of Rhine- 
beck, New York," records one Johannes 
Schmidt who was baptized there April 5. 1730, 
and married Elizabeth Zipperlee, February 3, 
1 761, and had a son Frederick. The name 
being the same and the dates bfing nearly so, 
it is strongly probable that Johannes of Rhine- 
beck and Johannes of Brunswick are the same. 

(I) Johannes Schmidt, son of Ludwig 
Schmidt, was born in Germany, emigrated to 



America, and is found associated in Rensselaer 
county. New York, at an early date with the 
Wager family, with whom he is said to have 
emigrated. He married and had issue.

was born in the town of Brunswick, Rens- 
selaer county, New York, February 19, 1783.

ter of an early settler of the town. Children : 
Katherine. John F., see forward, David, Bet- 
sey, Jonas, Sarah. Moses, Daniel and Silas. 
The File family are frequently found in the 
early records of Brunswick. The Schmidts 
were members of Gilead Lutheran church, 
where their family records are found. 

(III) John Frederick, eldest son of Fred- 
erick and Eva (File) Schmidt, was born in 
Brunswick, Rensselaer county. New York, De- 
cember 6, 1804, died at Clifton Park, New 
York, November 16, 1846. He was a farmer 
of the town and a member of the Lutheran 
church. He married Lanah Wager, born in 
Brunswick, Rensselaer county, "New York, 
November 3, 1810. Children: Mary Savilla, 
born October 6, 1831, married Francis A. 
Fales, of Troy; Evelyn, born May 7, 183—,

CAMPBELL est son and child of Archi-

nectady as county clerk from 1837 until 1843. 
He was a successful man of business, dealing 
in wholesale tobacco, and a leading member 
of the Episcopal church. His residence in the 
city was the finest at the time of its erection, 
located on LTnion near Center street. Fle mar- 
ried and had issue.

The branches of the .Amster- 
HOWGATE dam branch of the Howgate 
family were founded by Jo- 
seph Howgate, who was born in England. The 
family in that country is a large one, and is 
found all over the kingdom. They are farm- 
ers, manufacturers, business and professional 
men of standing in these localities. 

(I) Joseph Howgate came to Florida, 
Montgomery county, from England, early in 
the nineteenth century. When a young man 
he married Ann, daughter of David Brown, 
one of the old-time school masters of the 
county. Joseph and his wife settled on a 
farm in Saratoga county, where she died. .'Vf- 
ter her death Joseph removed to Grand Rap- 
ids. Michigan, where he died at an advanced 
age. He was a man of prominence in both 
communities. He had one son and four 
daughters, all now deceased.

wonderful skill and enterprise. He brought 
to the company a lifelong experience and a 
determination to succeed. He was successful 



1438

in his efforts, and the company is to-day one 
of Amsterdam's solid and prosperous con- 
cerns. Under the strain of excessive effort. 
both mental and physical, his health broke and 
caused his death at the early age of forty- 
four, just at the time when the business was 
firmly established on a sure and profitable foot- 
ing. His loss was a severe one to both the 
company and his family. He was a man of 
devout religious principles, being an elder in 
the church and superintendent of the Sabbath 
school. In politics he was a Republican, but 
beyond exercising his right as a citizen, took 
little part in public affairs. He married, in

The founder of the Fryer family 
FRYER in Albany county, and of the 

present day fortunes, was John 
Fryer, born October 4, 1759. Tradition has- 
different stories to tell of him. One is that 
he was a fisherman and rendered some one 
high in authority a specially valuable service. 
For this he received a grant of several hun- 
dred acres of choice land lying at the gate- 
way to the Helderburgs, near the "Indian 
Ladder." Why the grant was allowed is tra- 
dition, but the grant of land is a fact. The- 
tract allowed John Fryer is the only land 
that was not leased to the early settlers by 
the Patroon, and later acquired by "soil title." 
The Fryer properties have never been held 
under lease, but title has always been held and 
passed from father to son down to the pres- 
ent. John Fryer built a log cabin on his prop- 
erty, and with the aid of his sons, who came- 
with him, cleared away the timber, broke the 
fields, and brought a good part of it under 
cultivation. The land in turn passed to his 
descendants, and the "Fryer farms" are noted 
all through the Helderburg section. He was 
strict in his observance of his church duties, 
and reared his sons to habits of industry and 
thrift. They have always been a hard-work- 
ing race, and have been richly repaid, as their 
well-kept fields and bountiful orchards tes- 
tify. John Fryer married. May 25, 1783, 
Maria Volweider, born February 16, 1764. 
Children: Maria, born .-\pril 14, 1786; John, 
January 7, 1788, settled on a farm in Ohio; 
Hannah, October 3, 1790, married Jan-ies 
Mesick; Elizabeth, September 12, 1793, mar- 
ried Frank Crounse ; Jacob, born July 18, 1797 ; 
Abram. see forward ; Alexander, born June 23, 
1802. married Fanny Dollar; Barbara (twin 
of .Alexander), married Peter \'an Schaick, 
and lived in Berne, Albany county ; Richard, 
born .April 6, 1805, married Iluldah Beebe ; 
\\'illiam, August i, 1808, became a merchant 
of Amsterdam, New York. 

(II) .-\bram, son of John and Maria (\'ol- 
weider) Fryer, was born October 23, 1799, 
and lived to a very old age. He inherited the- 
farms granted to his father under the Helder- 
burgs, which he still further improved and 
brought under successful cultivation. These 
properties now came to be known as the 
"Fryer Farms." a name they still retain, and 
were among the most productive of that sec- 
tion. .Abram Fryer voted with the Whig 
party during his earlier years, and in his latter

life with the Republican. He married Nancy

(Crounse) Fryer, was born in Guilderland, 
Albany county, New York, June 23. 1827, 
died in the same town in June, 1880. He in- 
herited a large portion of the Fryer proper- 
ties, to which he added and still further im- 
proved. He was a man of few words, but of 
great energy and untiring industry. He spared 
neither himself nor those around him. Idle- 
ness was to him a sin, and no one on the 
Frj'er farms sinned in that particular. He 
demanded no more of others, however, than 
he himself performed. He accumulated a 
substantial competence, which was willed to 
his children. He was a member of the Luth- 
eran church, and displayed the same activity 
in religious affairs as in temporal. He was a 
trustee of the church, and worked hard for its 
upbuilding. He was a Republican in politics. 
He married, in Guilderland, November 3, 
1847, Eliza, born in that town, March 10,

Fryer homestead in the Helderburgs, in the 
region known as the "Indian Ladder," Au- 
gust 8, 1848. He inherited three hundred 
acres of the farm, to which he has added 



property in various locations. He has been 
an industrious farmer all his days, and the 
success he has achieved has been fairly won. 
He followed the footsteps of his father, and 
has always displayed the same energy that 
characterized him. The Fryer boys are noted 
throughout the entire section not only for their 
indu.strious habits, but for their fair dealing 
and honorable lives. Mr. Fryer attends the 
Lutheran church, and is a Republican in poli- 
tics. He married, in Guilderland, February 
10, 1887, Mary, born in that town, daughter

homestead farm, which he yet occupies. He 
has never departed from the habits of indus- 
try so sternly impressed upon him in his early 
days, but has been a worker all his life. The

where the original log cabin stood, built by his 
ancestor who first occupied the land. This

years old when his parents came to America 
and settled in Guilderland at the foot of the 
Helderburgs. The settlement in that section 
was not intended, but the mother, worn out 
by weeks and months of travel by sea and 
land, refused to go any further. Land was 
leased of the Rensselaer estate, to which "soil 
title" was afterward obtained. The family 
was a large one, and is still well represented 
in Albany county. Children of John and Mary

The Sweet family of Amsterdam, 
SWEET New York, descends from Dr. 

Samuel Sweet, immigrant an- 
cestor, who came to America from Wales, 
where the family name is not uncommon. A 
remarkable fact connected with the family is 
that each of the four generations in the 
United States has produced one or more mem- 
bers who have been noted for their skill in the 
treatment of diseases of the bones and joints. 
Their methods have been handed down from 
father to son, and while dififering from the 
regular prescribed treatment for such diseases 
laid down by regular schools of medicine, 
have been very successful. Each generation 
of the four has had a Dr. Sweet who enjoyed 
more than a local reputation for skill in bone 
surgery, that is described as a "simple, natural 
treatment." 

( I ) Dr. Samuel Sweet was born in Wales. 
He settled in Rhode Island at a date previous 
to the revolutionary war, and was then a com- 
paratively young man. He was noted around 
Providence for his skill in bone treatment and 
must have had the method taught him by his 
father in Wales. By his "natural treatment" 
he was able to perform some cures of dis- 
located bones and joints that were considered 
very remarkable. Leaving Providence. Rhode 
Island, he journeyed north and westward with 
his wife, whom he married in Rhode Island, 
using the method of transportation then avail- 
able — the covered wagon drawn by horses or 
oxen. He settled at Bullshead, Montgomery 
county. New York, on a farm where he re- 
sided until his death at an extreme old age. 
He was often called upon by his pioneer neigh- 
bors to treat their disabled or disjointed limbs 
and gained a reputation that extended far be- 
yond local limits. He reared a family and it 
is a matter of regret that the name of his wife 
has not been preserved. 

(II) Dr. Waterman, son of Dr. Samuel 
Sweet, was born in Providence, Rhode Island, 



April 8, 1776, died 1849. He inherited the 
method of bone treatment followed by his 
father. His fame extended over a large sec- 
tion of country, and he was much sought after 
by those afthcted with diseases he was reputed 
to successfully cure. To his business of a 
healer he added that of farmer, and was an 
active worker in the Baptist church. He 
studied theology and was licensed to preach, 
which he often did, in fact was known as 
widely as a preacher as a healer. During his 
latter years his eyes failed and he became 
totally blind. So skilled was he and of such 
delicate touch that his blindness did not in- 
terfere with his work of healing. He was 
greatly respected all over Montgomery county. 
At the time of his death, 1849. he was living in 
Amsterdam, New York. Rev. Waterman 
Sweet married, in New York, Elizabeth 
Hodges, born in New England, died in Ams- 
terdam, and buried in Florida, Montgomery 
county. New York. 

(III) Dr. Waterman (2), son of Dr. Water- 
man (i) and Elizabeth (Hodges) Sweet, was 
born in Florida, Montgomery county, New 
York, August 12, 1809, died August 20. 1886. 
He also became famous as a "bone healer," 
having succeeded to his father's practice. He 
cultivated a small farm successfully and died 
possessed of considerable property. He and 
his wife were members of the Baptist church. 
He married, in Florida, New York, Ruth Mal- 
lory, born in Florida, June i, 1815. died March 
28, 1902. Children: i. Elizabeth, born Au- 
gust I, 1839, died July 25, 1859. 2. and 3. 
Twins, died in infancy. 4. Waterman (3), 
April 17, 1843. 5- David M., see forward. 
6. Ira S., March 14, 1849; resides in Utica, 
New York, and is a successful practitioner of 
the family method of bone treatment : married 
Martha Brown and has five children. 7. 
Sherod L., November 6, 1850. died aged three 
years. 8. Leonard G., November 21, 1852, 
died Tanuarv 21, 1890. 

(IV) Dr.' David M., son of Dr. Waterman 
(2) and Ruth (Mallory) Sweet, was born in 
Florida, Montgomery county. New York, June 
4, 1845. He quite naturally adopted the pro- 
fession of his father, in which he has achieved 
remarkable success besides a local patronage, 
peo])le from all over the United States coming 
to consult him concerning their bone ailments. 
He has resided for many years in .\msterdam, 
New York, where he is a highly respected 
citizen and professional man. He has now 
(1909) largely withdrawn from active prac- 
tice, surrendering it to his son, who is the 
fifth of his name to follow the particular 
methods employed. The "Old Original Sweet's 
Liniment" was made by the emigrant who

settled in Rhode Island, and the same liniment 
is used to this day. Dr. David M. Sweet mar- 
ried, December 23, 1863, Hannah M. Greene, 
born June 11, 1843, in Greenfield, Saratoga 
county, New York. Children: i. Emma L., 
born November 11, 1864; married John S. 
Sterling, of Pattersonville, New York ; they 
have a son, Lincoln S., born October 11, 1894. 
2. Harry L., November 30, 1869; was edu- 
cated in the public schools and is rapidly suc- 
ceeding to the business of his father, whom 
he will succeed as the fifth in direct line to 
follow the "natural method" ; married Harriet 
M. Ransler, born in Schenectady, New York, 
June 13, 1874; has one child, Vinnie M. 3. 
Vinnie E., August 21, 1873, died February 3,

Greene, born in Saratoga county, New York, 
January 23, 1814, died June i, 1891, and 
Lucinda (Lincoln) Greene, born in Saratoga 
county, March 7, 1818, died November 9, 1851. 
Anson Greene was the son of James Greene, 
born in Rhode Island, died in Saratoga county. 
New York, aged seventy-seven. James Greene 
married Pamelia Hendrick, who died in May, 
1868, aged seventy-one. Lucinda Lincoln, 
wife of Anson Greene, was daughter of Henry 
and Hannah (White) Lincoln, who were mar- 
ried in Rhode Island, settled in Saratoga 
county. New York, where they died, both 
having passed their eightieth year. 



The American ancestor of the 
RUDD Ruds of Bennington, Vermont, 

and Hoosick, New York, is Lieu- 
tenant Jonathan Rudd, who came from Eng- 
land, settled in New Haven, Connecticut, 
1640; was freeman of Saybrook, 1644, took 
oath of allegiance in Hartford, 165 1, was of 
importance in the town of Saybrook, assistant 
to Captain Mason in the fort there, 1652, 
leather sealer, 1656, and held main public of- 
fices of trust. He married, 1646-47, the name 
unknown, but she was one of the principals in 
the most romantic marriages ever performed 
in Connecticut. The wedding day was fixed 
and a magistrate engaged to perform the cere- 
mony, but a great snowstorm prevented his 
coming. Application was made to Governor 
Winthrop, but he, deriving authority from 
Massachusetts, could not legally marry in 
Massachusetts, but proposed that the contract- 
ing parties come to the boundary of the col- 
ony, a narrow stream, and he would marry 
them from the Massachusetts side. This was 
done, and Winthrop and his friends from 
Pequot met the bridal party from Saybrook. 
Here the ceremony was performed "under the 
shelter of no roof, by no hospitable fireside, 



without accommodations, but those furnished 
by the snow covered earth, the over-arching 
Heaven and perchance the sheltering side of a 
forest of pines or cedars," never perhaps was 
the legal rite performed in a situation so wild 
and solitary and under circumstances so pecu- 
liar and interesting. From that day the little 
stream has been known as Bride Brook. Win- 
throp in his deposition says : "And at that 
time, the place had (received) the denomina- 
tion of Bride Brook." That a considerable 
party had assembled is evident from the nar- 
rative, and he further says, "all were well, 
satisfied with what was done." 

(II) Nathaniel, believed to be son of Lieu- 
tenant Jonathan Rudd, was born in 1660, died 
April, 1727. He settled at West Farms, in 
what is now the town of Franklin, where he 
was one of the organizers of the first church 
there. He married (first) April, 1685, Mary 
Post, died November, 1705; (second) Abigail 
Hartshorn, January 21, 1706. Children by 
first marriage: Jonathan, born May 22, 1693, 
married Joanna Gregory ; Mary, February 3, 
1695, married Ebenezer Wood ; Lydia, died 
young. Children by second marriage : Na- 
thaniel, born April 6, 1707; Joseph, of further 
mention; Daniel, March 12, 1710, married 
Mary Metcalf; Sarah, January 23, 1712; .\bi- 
gail, August 6, 1713; Lydia, April 12, 1715; 
Anna, February 7, 1717; Susanna, March 15, 
1719: Gideon, February 2, 1722; Patience, No- 
vember 6. 1723. 

(III) Joseph, son of Nathaniel and Abigail' 
(Hartshorn) Rudd. was born in Windham, 
Connecticut, October 31, 1708. He probably, 
died there shortly after the revolution. He 
married and h'ul several children, as Joseph his 
son says in this letter, written after the battle 
of Bennington that "Brother John and my- 
self," and closes by sending love to his broth- 
ers and sisters. 

(IV) Joseph (2), son of Joseph (i) Rudd, 
was born in Connecticut, 1740, died 1818. He 
settled in Vermont, married and was living in 
Bennington at the time the battle was fought 
with the British, in 1777. The following let- 
ter was written to his father : 

"Bennington, August 26, A. D. 1777. 
Honored Father: 

After my duty. I take this opportunity to write 
yon. hoping these line.'; will find you well, a.s 
through the goodness of God, they leave me and' 
my family. We met with a great deal of trnuhle 
on the i6th inst.. Myself and brother John were 
preserved through a very hot battle. We killed' 
and took according to the best account we can 
get, about one thousand of the enemy. Our loss 
was about thirty or forty. We marched right 
up against their breastwork with our small arms, 
while they fired upon us with their field pieces 
every half minute, yet they never touched ai

man with them. We drove them out of their 
breastwork, and took their field pieces and pur- 
sued and killed a great number of them. We 
took four or five of my neighbors, two Snyders 
and two Hornbecks. The bigger part of Dutch 
Hoosac was in the battle against us. They went 
to the regulars a day or two before the fight. 
While I was gone, my wife and children went 
down to Williamstown. After I came home, I 
went after them and found them at Landlord 
Simons. I now have them home again. We 
soon expect the inemy will come upon us again 
and what I will do with my family, I know not. 
I want to inform you, that I received your 
letter, dated August i8. I want to come and 
see you very much, but when I shall I know 
not. Remember me to brothers and sisters and 
inquiring friends. Ko more at present, but I re- 
main, 

"Your dutiful son, until death, 

"Joseph Rudd." 

This letter is preserved in the Historical 
Museum at Bennington, Vermont. He was 
one of the signers of a petition sent to Eng- 
land and presented to the court of Great Brit- 
ain in 1767; this petition represented the 
grievance of the settlers against the govern- 
ment of New York, and prayed for a confir- 
mation of the New Hampshire grants held or 
occupied by them. At the raising of the 
Hubble house in 1769 a demand was made 
for a wedding. It was known that Joseph 
Rudd and Miss Story were engaged. She lived 
near by. Rev. Mr. Dewey said to Joseph : "If 
you go and lead Sarah over here I will marry 
you for nothing." "It's a bargain." Timbers 
were laid down and the ceremony performed. 
Joseph Rudd married Sarah Story, who died 
1842. aged ninety-eight years. Sarah Story 
was of revolutionary stock and was acquainted 
with Colonel Ethan Allen. One of her broth- 
ers, a boy of sixteen, was taken prisoner with 
Allen. Another brother was captured by In- 
dians in Connecticut and the second night he 
made his escape. (The following record is 
taken from a paper written by a grand- 
daughter. Mrs. Elizabeth Harris, when over 
seventy years of age. The manuscript is

factory, remaining until he became an expert 
workman and thoroughly understood every 
detail of box manufacturing. Having only a 
limited capital, he erected a small factory and 
began business for himself; without machinery 
he operated in a small way, making all his 
boxes by hand labor. He was industrious, 
ambitious, and bound to succeed. In a few 
years he had a large factory fully equipped 
with modern box-making machinery. After 
sixteen years close application to business,

entire business in 1900 and retired from ac-

little shop until a safe start was secured, 
and now enjoying, with him. their well-earned 
competence. She is a daughter of Augustus 
and Mary (Saunders) Miller, born in Ger-

The Wayne family are men- 
WAYNE tioned in the early records of 
Yorkshire and Derbyshire, Eng- 
land, where for centuries they held position 
among the lesser gentry. These old Waynes 
bore the Qiristian names of Anthony, Gabriel 
and Francis, and many of them were soldiers 
by profession, some of them in the "War 
of the Roses." and mostly upon the side 
of their king. Among them was Captain 
Gabriel Wayne, apparently a near kinsman of 
Captain Anthony Wayne, the founder of the 
Waynes in America. The family in Eng- 
land bore arms : "Gules a chevron ermine 
between three inside quantlets or." Anthony 
Wayne was born near the border line of 
Yorkshire and Derbyshire in the year 1666. 
He early became a soldier, and while yet a 
lad saw service in the low countries, it is said, 
under John Churchill, later the great Duke 
of Marllx)rough. He was with the English 
army in Ireland, and commanded a troop 
of horse at the "Boyne Water." in company 
with his lifelong friend. John Hunter, both 
of whom later settled down as farmers in 
county Wicklow, one having married a French 
woman, the other a native of Holland. .'An- 
thony Wayne settled near Rathdrum, Wick- 
low, Ireland, after 1690. His wife was named 
Faulkner, and he had seven sons, five of 
whom came to America. .Anthony Wayne 
and family landed near Boston. Massachu- 
setts, in 1723, and almost immediately pro- 
ceeded to Pennsylvania, where they settled 



M45 

in Chester county. Here he found his old 
companion-in-arms, John Hunter, who had 
settled there in 1722. He purchased land 
at Easttown, Chester county, and is described 
in the deed as "Anthony Wayne, gentleman." 
Captain Anthony Wayne died in Easttown, 
December 2, 1739, and was buried in old St. 
David's, Radnor, where he was a vestryman 
and pewholder. Children: Francis, Gabriel, 
Isaac, Humphrey, Jacob, William, John, 
Sarah, Ann and Mary. The home Captain 
Anthony Wayne founded in Chester county 
was called Waynesborough. and is yet the 
home of descendants. 

(II) Isaac, third son of Captain Anthony 
Wayne, was born in Ireland, and died in 
Chester county, Pennsylvania. He was a cap- 
tain in the colonial wars, 1755, and is said 
to have been at Braddock's defeat. He served 
with honor all througli his military career, 
and died on the eve of tiie American revolu- 
tion, leaving a son wiiose brilliant record, cov- 
ering the entire period of the war, and ex- 
tending from the frozen Canada's to the tropic 
Florida, fills some of the most important pages 
of the history of our country. 

(III) Anthony (2), son of Isaac Wayne, 
and known as "Mad" Anthony Wayne, the 
hero of everywhere, was brigadier-general 
in 1777; major-general by brevet, 1783-92; 
nominated by Washington as commander-in- 
chief of the army, which position he held un- 
til his death, near Erie, Pennsylvania. Decem- 
ber 15, 1796. The Wayne family, of New 
Scotland, Albany county, New York, herein 
recorded, were planted in that county by 
Anthony Wayne, a grandson of Captain .-\n- 
thony, the American founder. He was a 
cousin of General Anthony Wayne, and was 
of the third generation of Waynes in .Amer- 
ica, and one of the early settlers in the town 
of New Scotland, the date of his settlement 
being during, or immediately after, the revolu- 
tion. He was an active patriot, and did not 
fall one whit behind his illustrious relative 
in devotion to the colonial cause. New Scot- 
land then had few inhabitants, and among the 
loyal ones were William McCullock, Anthony 
Wayne. John Furbeck. John Wanrls. Robert 
Hilton, Albert Bradt. and the La Grange fam- 
ily. He married and had issue. 

(IV) George, son of Anthony (2) Wayne, 
was born on the home farm in New Scotland, 
Albany county, New York, December 8. 1779, 
died May 10, 1837. He spent his life as a 
farmer of the town, prospered, and was a

lege, where he was graduated A.B., class 
of 1876. He decided upon the profession of 
law and pursued a course of legal study under 
Judge Lester, of Saratoga, was admitted to 
the bar, but never practised. In 1876 he en-

The founder of the McKin- 
]\IcKINXEY ney family was Calinas Fitz- 
gerald, of Ireland, who as- 
sisted Alexander III, of Scotland, to repel 
the invasion of Haco, of Norway, 1261, and 
was rewarded by a grant of the lands of Kin- 
tail, county of Ross, in the north of Scot- 
land, and which was erected into a barony. 
The third baron assumed in name (in Gaelic), 
Kenneth McKenneth, hence the names Mc- 
Kennie, McKinney, and McKenzie. Members 
of the family bearing the last two names 
have been able, in this century, to trace their 
ancestry to an identical source. 

Alexander McKenzie, of Inverness, Scot- 
land, in his genealogies, traces the family back 
to the beginning of the ninth century. He 
finally states : "It scarcely needs to be pointed 
out that, through intermarriages the McKs. 
are also descended from the ancient Celtic 
McAlpine line of Scottish kings, from the 
original Anglo-Saxon kings, of England, and 
from the oldest Scandinavian, Charlemagne 
and Capetian lines, as far back as the begin- 
ning of the ninth century, forming a network 
of cousinship which ultimately included all 
the leading families in the Highlands, every 
one of which, through these alliances, have 
the royal blood of all the English, Scottish and 
Scandinavian kings, and many of the earlier 
foreign monarchs, coursing through their 
veins." 

Passing along the centuries, we come to 
that rcmarkalile man, the Rev. James McKin- 
ney, grandfather of James McKinney. He was 
born in Cookstown, Tyrone county, Ireland, 
in 1759. This county was included in that 
portion of Ulster made "Sword-land" by the 
Scots. He entered Glasgow College, where 
he took the regular course, and remained 



there several years after, engaged in the 
study of theology and of medicine. In due 
time he was ordained and installed pastor of 
Kirkhills, or Dervock congregations, in the 
county of Antrim, a county exposed to the 
inroads of the Danes, and also of the northern 
Scots, who ultimately effected permanent set- 
tlements. Antrim has always been one of 
the most decidedly Protestant counties in Ire- 
land, and of the Protestants a very great pro- 
portion are Presbyterians. 

(I) The last decade of the eighteenth cen- 
tury was pre-eminently distinguished for its 
revolutionary character in several European 
nations. Rev. James McKinney lived in revo- 
lutionary times. He came to America in 
1793. As a friend of liberty, civil and re- 
ligious, he saw and felt with disapprobation 
the oppression of his native land, and, though 
he did not belong to the Society of United 
Irishmen, yet he was charged with influencing 
and encouraging them to throw ofif the Brit- 
ish yoke. The true cause of his leaving his 
native land was his sermon on the "Rights of 
God." This was denounced as treasonable by 
the secret spies of the British government. 
An indictment was found against him, and 
being feared by the government and an ob- 
ject of jealousy, they determined to seize and 
imprison him. He was providentially away 
from home when the soldiers came to arrest 
him, and as bail on a charge of treason would 
not be accepted, he escaped to America in 
the summer of 1793. 

'i'hough not sent immediately by the church 
in Ireland to aid in promoting the Covenant- 
ing cause in this country, it is evident that 
lie was sent by the Head of the Church him- 
self. In an article on "The Life and Times 
of Rev. James McKinney," by Rev. S. Car- 
lisle, he .says: "We do not state too much 
when we assert he was the founder, under 
God, of the Reformed Presbyterian Church 
in the L'nited States, after the secession and 
backsliding in 1783." Dr. (jlasgow, in his 
"History of the Reformed Presbyterian 
Church in America," and Sprague's "Annals 
of the American Pulpit." state that "for schol- 
arship and eloquence combined, he was not 
only the greatest man in the Covenanter 
Church in his day, but he was a great man 
among men of that age. His sermons were a 
continuous stream of thought, and for 
grandeur of conception and impressiveness of 
delivery such displays of eloquence were sel- 
dom heard." They also quote an eminent 
divine as .saying, "I have met with many con- 
siderable and some great men, Init not one 
equal to James McKinney." .Anotlier said, 
"He is like Leviathan — made witinnit fear."

Such are the testimonies of men on both sides 
of the Atlantic to the character of Rev. James 
McKinney. 

Prior to 1812 four brothers of Rev. James 
McKinney had emigrated to America : Rev. 
Samuel McKinney, D.D., of Texas; Dr. 
Archibald JMcKinney, who was for some time 
partner of Dr. Rush, of Philadelphia, and 
died at Cincinnati, Ohio; Robert McKinney, 
who located, and died near Pittsburg, Penn- 
sylvania; and Hon. John A. McKinney, one 
of the framers of the constitution of Tennes- 
see, and who died at Rogersville, East Ten- 
nessee. 

Rev. James McKinney was called to the 
congregation of Rocky Creek, Chester Dis- 
trict, South Carolina, whither he removed, 
died in a few months, away from his family, 
and was buried in the old graveyard on Rocky 
Creek. It may be said of this family that 
they inherited and illustrated all the noble 
qualities of their heroic ancestors, and veri- 
fied the promise, "I will be a God to thee and 
thy children after thee." Freedom, civil and 
religious, was dearer to them than titles and 
wealth. 

(H) Four years later, in 1797, Mary 
(Mitchell) McKinney, wife of Rev. James 
McKinney, followed, with their five children, 
one of whom was James (2) McKinney, 
father of James (3) McKinney of this re- 
view. He was born in 1792. He was edu- 
cated for the ministry, but was not ordained. 
He lived a quiet, uneventful life, was se- 
dentary in his habits, and devoted to his 
books. 

James McKinney's maternal grandfather 
was John I. Netterville, who forfeited his 
succession to the peerage by coming to 
America. The family of Netterville is of 
Norman descent, and of considerable an- 
tiquity ; it took from an early period an im- 
portant and historic position in Ireland, and 
made high connections and alliances. It was 
settled at Douth, county Meath, in the reign 
of Henry II. During the persecution of the 
Protestants this family left France for the 
North of Ireland, and sailed up the coast. 
His maternal grandmother was Lady .Vnn 
Whitely, daughter of Lord Edward Whitcly, 
North of Ireland. Jane Frances (Netter- 
ville) McKinney. mother of James McKinney, 
came to America in 1802, when nine years of 
age. Such were the forebears of James Mc- 
Kinney, indicating that the blood flowing in 
his veins was of that sturdy, self-reliant qual- 
ity which knew no discouragement and feared 
nothing so much as untrustworthiness. 

(Ill) James (3), son of James (2) and 
Tane Frances (Netterville) McKinney, was 



born August 29, 1825, in Duanesburg, Sche- 
nectady county, New York. In 1838 he went 
to Canajoharie, Montgomery county, where 
for some years he attended Canajoharie 
Academy, making his home with his maternal 
grandfather, John T. Netterville, of the same 
place. In 1844 he accepted a position in the 
iron works conducted by Colonel George G. 
Johnson, of Palatine Bridge, New York, re- 
maining three years. In 1847 Mr- McKinney 
went to New York and sought employment 
with several concerns in different lines of 
the iron business in order to perfect himself 
in the industry, for, like many other young 
men, his aim wms to ultimately engage in 
business for himself, and he desired to obtain 
all the information and experience possible, 
with that end in view. In 18510 he came to 
Albany, and in 1857 began business 
for himself, forming a co-partnership 
with Abram Mann, under the firm name 
of McKinney & Mann, in a small foun- 
dry located on Lower Livingston avenue 
(then Lumber street). This foundry was 
demolished when the fir.st bridge was con- 
structed across the Hudson river at Albany, 
and the business was removed to buildings 
especially constructed for the firm at i8-20' 
De Witt street. In 1867 the partnership was 
dissolved, and Air. McKinney continued the 
business alone. About this time he observed 
the growing demand for structural and archi- 
tectural iron work for building purposes, and 
he decided to devote practically his whole 
attention to this branch of the iron industry. 
The business grew so rapidly that larger 
quarters were soon a necessity, and in 1872- 
he erected the works on upper Rroadway, 
where the business has since been conducted. 
In 1884 he admitted his son, Edward N. Mc- 
Kinney, into partnership, and this firm has 
ever since continued under the name of James 
McKinney & Son. When Mr. McKinney 
first engaged in business, he resolved to manu- 
facture only first-class work, for he realized 
that whatever was worth doing at all was 
worth doing well, and the result was that 
the reputation established at the beginning, 
for first-class work, was continued during 
all the years of his business career. He was 
a man of the highest ideals in honesty and in- 
tegrity, and as to what was due his fellow- 
men, and these qualities, combined with a 
genial disposition and a heart warm with 
generous impulses, attracted not only custom- 
ers and friends, who remained with him dur- 
ing his entire business life, but also the loy- 
alty and friendship of the men in his employ. 
In 1872 Mr. McKinney was elected a mem- 
ber of the board of aldermen and served

two years. In 1856 he joined the Fourth 
Presbyterian Church of Albany, and in 1874 
was elected to the eldership, which office he 
retained until the close of his life. He was 
devotedly attached to this church, and every 
branch of its work received his earnest sup- 
port. He was particularly interested in young 
men who wished to devote their lives to the 
Christian ministry, and was always a liberal 
■contributor in aiding such to secure an edu- 
cation with this end in view, when their 
private means were inadequate for the pur- 
pose. He was elected a trustee of the Albany 
Exchange Savings Bank in 1886, and became 
its second vice-president in 1893. 

Mr. McKinnev married, in 1850, JuHa A., 
Poole, of Albany. Children : Ella F. ; Ida A., 
married David B. Hunt, of Montclair, New 
Jersey; Edward N. Mr. McKinney died Feb- 
ruarv 10. 1907. The worth of his character 
and the loss to the community in his death 
were attested by the local press in the fol- 
lowing : 

Albany Evening Journal, February II. 1907: 
■"James McKinney's long career of usefulness 
came to an end about three weeks ago, and yes- 
terday death ensued. From the time he laid 
•down the cares of busine,ss life, which had ex- 
tended over half a century, his vigorous consti- 
tution gave way gradually, and in a compara- 
tively short time the vital spark went out. It 
was like passing to a peaceful sleep, and was in 
keeping with his gentle nature. His presence 
was like a healing balm, his counsel always on 
the right side, and his charity unostentatious. 
Mr. McKinney's record in the business circles of 
Albany, in the city's welfare and in church 
work, stands out a bright page. His genial 
■disposition, his wise judgment in all matters in 
which he was enlisted, and his business acumen, 
will be missed by those who were thrown into 
his companionship." 

Ibid, same date: "The death of James Mc- 
Kinney, which occurred yesterday, makes an- 
■other vacant place in the ranks of the old guard 
of Albany's business men — the men to whose 
activity and energy is due in gerat measure the 
city's very solidly founded prosperity. Fifty 
years of successful business activity, always char- 
acterized by strict integrity, made a record most 
honorable, a source of pride to those who mourn. 
Mr. McKinney's life is an example for emula- 
tion to those who are just beginning their busi- 
ness careers." 

Albany Times-Union, February 11, 1907: "In 
the death of James McKinney, .Mbany loses one 
•of its most progressive citizens. His splendid 
•efforts to promote the welfare of the large in- 
stitution over which he presided were crowned 
with success, and the iron works which bear 
liis name are known throughout the length and 
"breadth of the land. He was a generous em- 
ployer, a good citizen and a faithful friend, and 
a splendid type of virile manhood." 

Knickerbocker Express. February 11, 1907: 
"The close of Sabbath witnessed the death of one 
of those sweet, lovable gentlemen of the old 
■school, of whom the world to-day has too few. 



A gentleman whose integrity was unimpeachable; 
in whom the milk of human kindness abounded 
in rich supply: whose optimism was ever most 
pronounced; whose life of four-score years and 
two speaks eloquently his own epitaph; whose 
love for humanity was as sweet as the perfume 
of incense — such was James McKinney, one of 
Albany's best-known business men." 



The paternal descent of the Daw 
DAW family of Troy is through French 
Huguenot ancestors, who fled from 
the city of Rochelle in France and came to 
America, where a large settlement of people 
of the same religious convictions founded 
New Rochelle, near New York City. The 
names of two of the Daw ancestors are on 
the Huguenot monument at New Rochelle as 
founders of New Rochelle. Through inter- 
marriage with the Denisons they obtain de- 
scent from Captain George Denison, a noted 
Indian fighter of Connecticut, whose wife, 
Ann Boradaile, was an English lady of rank. 
His father was William Denison, who came 
to America in 163 1 and settled in Roxbury, 
Massachusetts. 

Captain George Denison returned to 
England after the death of his first wife, 
joined the army of Cromwell, was wounded 
at the battle of Naseby. was nursed back to 
life at the home of John Boradaile by his 
daughter Ann, whom he afterward married; 
he returned to America and settled at Ston- 
ington, Connecticut, where he died in 1694. 
As a leader of the volunteer forces, he broke 
the power of the Indians and gave peace to 
the harassed settlers. The descent is through 
Captain John, eldest son of Captain George 
and .\nn (Boradaile) Denison: Daniel, child 
of Captain John and Phoebe Denison ; Daniel 
(2), who was the ninth child of Daniel (i) 
and Mary Denison; Daniel (3), second child 
of Daniel (2) and Esther Denison; Esther, 
born 1776, third child of Daniel (3) and 
Elizabeth Denison, who married Miner Wal- 
den, of Pawlet, Vermont ; removed to Albany 
county. New York, where the mother of

blind. He continued playing in public until 
he was seventy-five, rendering his selections 
from memory. Until he was eighty-five he 
retained his musical skill and kept up his 
playing, although not appearing in public. 
His musical memory was wonderful, having 
a repertoire of sixty quadrilles and about 
thirty other compositions for dance and con- 
cert that he recited from memory without a 
discordant note, excelling in dance and popu-

was a son of Thomas Burtt, of New Hamp- 
shire, also a noted musician and violin per- 
former. He owned a genuine Cremona violin 
that is now in possession of a great-grandson,

Tracing the gene- 
SCHIFFERDFCKER alogy of this 'fam- 
ily back brings the 
searcher to the Duchy of Baden-Baden, now 
empire of Germany. There for generation 
after generation the family of Schifferdecker 
were prosperous and influential. They were 
intimately associated with public afifairs and 
furnished soldiers that made reputations for 
bravery on the field of battle. The first of 
the family to arrive in the United States was 
Henry Schiflferdecker, born in Baden-Baden 
in 1798. He was a butcher and dealer in 
meats, etc. This has been the i)revailing 
family occupation and business down to the 
present generation. He married and had a

family of eight children, all born in Baden- 
Baden. He remained in business in Germany 
until his family were well grown and his 
sons liable to conscription for military duty 
in the Germany army. In 1849, '^^'^^^'' ^'''s wife 
and entire family, he took passage for the 
United States, where they arrived eight 
weeks later. The family settled in Albany 
where Henry began business anew, following 
the same line as in Germany. He continued 
the butcher business, assisted by his son, until 
his death in 1858. He was thrifty, indus- 
trious and highly respected. His widow sur- 
vived him until October 17, 1890, dying on 
her birthday, which was October 17, just 
eighty-four years earlier in the century, 1806. 
Children: Carl, deceased; Frederick A., see 
forward ; Morris ; Henry, deceased ; Louisa, 
deceased : Caroline ; Lizzie, deceased ; Rosa. 

(H) Captain Frederick A., second son of 
Henry Schiflferdecker, was born in Baden- 
Baden, Germany, February 2, 1836, died in 
Albany, New York. November 24, 1908. He 
came to Albany with his father in 1849, ^"d 
assisted him in the meat business until he 
arrived at the age of twenty-one, when he 
began business for himself. He w-as a suc- 
cessful business man and became prominent 
in city politics. In 1862 he responded to Presi- 
dent Lincoln's call for men to crush out the 
rebellion then existing in the southern states. 
He enlisted as a private in the Forty-sixth 
Regiment, New York \^olunteer Infantry, and 
came home after three years valiant service 
as captain. He won his commission for 
bravery on the field of battle and demon- 
strated the quality of his courage on more 
than one hard-fought battlefield. A proof of 
his valor now decorates the Hall of Flags 
in the State Capitol at Albany. It is a 
battle-flag captured from the enemy in battle 
and is a special credit to his company. He 
represented his ward in Albany as supervisor 
several terms, and in 1874 was elected a 
member of the state assembly of New York. 
He was a stalwart Republican and always 
active in politics. He was a member of Ver- 
non Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons, and 
a highly respected citizen. He was a Luth- 
eran in religious faith. He married, Anna 
Rapp, of Hanover, Germany. Children: i. 
Charles F., see forward. 2. Frederick A., 
born July 19, i860; was well educated in 
the public schools of Albany ; became an as- 
sistant in his father's meat market ; was su- 
pervisor of his ward several terms ; president 
of the first ward Republican committee for 
sixteen years, and was slated for the Re- 
publican party nomination for treasurer of 
Albany county, an intention frustrated by his 



death ; he was a rising and most promising 
young man, whose death was keenly re- 
gretted; married Louise Heidrich, who sur- 
vives him, living in Albany with children: 
Edna, Dorothy, Anna, Charles F. and George 
N. 3. Anna, married John Heidrich, of Al- 
bany; children: John, Frederick, Irene. .Anna 
and Arthur. 4. Loisetta, married Henry H. 
Wadbil, a gaugcr in the United States inter- 
nal revenue service, stationed at Plattsburg, 
New York; children. Jeannette, Elizabeth 
Doris, William, Mildred and Marvin. 

(Ill) Charles F., eldest son of Frederick 
A. and Anna (Rapp) Schifferdecker, was born 
in Albany, New York, April 4, 1858. He was 
educated in the public schools, worked with 
his father in the meat business until 1877, 
when he and his brothers established the ice 
business under firm name of Schiflferdecker 
Brothers. He has developed this to large 
proportions and is one of the largest dealers 
in Albany. He has a cold storage plant in 
Albany with a capacity' of twenty thousand 
tons. He is a prominent and active member 
of the Republican party. In 1897 he was 
elected sheriff of Albany county, and gave a 
practical business administration of the aflfairs 
of that important office. He was a member 
of the Republican committee of the first ward 
for six years. He is a member of the Ma- 
sonic fraternity, belonging to lodge, chapter 
and commandery. His position in the city of 
Albany is an enviable one and has been gained 
by earnest, conscientious effort, doing well 
whatever came in his line of duty. His private 
aflfairs were no more carefully conducted than 
have been the public trusts committed to 
him. He married. May 16, 1883, in Albany, 
Elizabeth Bildhauser, born in Albany, Octo- 
ber 17, 1859. daughter of Frederick and Cathe- 
rine (Damm) Bildhauser, who came to the

The family of Millard came 
MILLARD originally from the county of 

Southampton. England, wliere 
they possessed considerable estates now in the 
occupation of John Millard, of that county. 
The name first appears in .American colonial 
records in 1654 when lands in Massachusetts, 
and afterwards in New Hampshire, were 
granted to Luke IMillard. In 1670 John Mil- 
lard had a grant of land from William Penn 
in Pennsylvania, and another brother had 
lands in Virginia. John Millard, of South- 
ampton, England, was admitted a freeman of 
Newport, Rhode Island. He married Eliza- 
beth - — ■ ■. He later was of Rehoboth, Mas- 
sachusetts, and had issue. Through intermar- 
riages, the Millards are connected with the old- 
est English, Scotch and Dutch families of the 
United States, notably the Coffins. Folgers and 
Starbucks of Nantucket, and Massachusetts ; 
the Greenes and Brownes of Rhode Island, the 
Akins of Dutchess county. New York, the 
Ten Eyckes of Albany, the Bellows and Goulds 
of New Haven, and many others.

William Sabin first apjjears in 1643, at the 
organization of the county of Rehoboth. Ma.s- 
sachusetts. It is not known when or how

and it is believed that after his flight from 
France he found refuge in Wales or the South 
of England. He was a man of wealth and 
culture, and of an exceedingly kind, generous 
nature if one can judge from his gifts to re- 
lieve the wants of those who suffered from 
Indian raids. He was a leader in Plymouth

(The Folger Line). 

Closely allied with the Coffin family of Nan- 
tucket Island was the Folger. When the 
first English settlement was effected on the 
island, July 16, 1661, the first great need of 
the colonists was for an interpreter through 
whom they might speak with the Indians who 
peopled the island. So they sent to the island 
of Martha's Vineyard, and offered to give a 
half of one share of their estate to Peter Fol- 
ger if he would come over to Nantucket and 
live with them. John Folger came from Eng- 
land in 1656 and as a surveyor laid out the 
town of Norwich, Suffolk county, Massachu- 
setts. He afterward settled on Nantucket. He 
married Meribah Gibbs and had issue. 

(II) Peter, son of John Folger, was an 
Englishman. He was a teacher to the Indians 
of the Vineyard. He knew how to measure 
and survey lands and laid out the original 
lots on Nantucket. He took up his residence 
on Nantucket, and in 1673 was clerk of writs 
and recorder of the court. There was a great 
deal of dissension and bad feeling in 1675-76 
over the election, which seemed to be a tri- 
umph for the younger men over the older. 
Peter Folger in his letter of complaint to Gov- 
ernor Andros at New York speaks contemptu- 
ously of "our new young chief magistrates," 
whereupon he was put under arrest. He was 
ordered to produce the "Court Booke," but al- 
though he came to the court, answered not to 
the summons as required. Another was chosen 
clerk of the court and an indictment found 
against Peter for contempt of court. He was 
placed under £20 bail and not finding an im- 
mediate bondsman was locked up in a place 
which he describes as "A place where never 
any Englishman was put and where the neigh- 
bors hogs had laved but the night before and 
in a bitter cold frost and deep snow," but 
friends brought him bedding and food. His 
name aj^pears as a witness on the Indian deed 
of Nantucket, "Recorded for Mr. Tristram 
Coffin and Mr. Thomas Macy ye 29th day of 
June, 1671, aforesaid" (Deeds 11 1954, secre- 
tary office). Also on the Indian deed of

land he left his church in charge of Peter 
Folger. He married Mary Morrell and had 
issue.

original proprietors in 1780 gave him a grant 
of five hundred acres in consideration of his 
building and maintaining a grist mill in the 
town. Joseph and Delia (Mead) Curtis are

gleston was son of Benedict Eggleston. who 
during the revolution enlisted in the Second 
Connecticut Regiment when he was so young 
and undersized that he put on false heels to 
bring him up to hei.ght and perhaps did some- 
thing similar to bring his age up to the re- 
quirements. He was in receipt of a revolu- 
tionary pension for forty years. Born at IIop-

The family has been allied by intermarriages

HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



with many of the honorable families of Eng- 
land and even with royalty. Probably the 
most eminent of the name in England was Sir 
William Coffin. Knight in the reign of King 
Henry \'nL Tristram Coffyn, the American 
ancestor, was of the landed gentry, son of 
Peter, and grandson of Nicholas. According 
to his father's will he was to be provided 
for "According to his degree and calling." 
Therefore he must have had a calling or pro- 
fession, although he never in America made 
any pretentions. 

(I) Tristram ("Tristem") Cofifyn, as he al- 
ways signed his name, the founder of the 
family line in America, was born at Buxton, 
a small parish and village near Plymouth, in 
Devonshire. England, in the year 1605. He 
married Dionis Stevens, daughter of Robert 
Stevens, Esq., of Buxton, and in 1642 emigra- 
ted to America with his wife, five small chil- 
dren, his widowed mother and two unmar- 
ried sisters. He lived alternately in Salis- 
bury, Haverhill and Newbury, Massachusetts, 
until 1659, when he went to Nantucket Island 
and arranged for the purchase of the island 
by a company which he organized in Salis- 
bury. The island was then under the juris- 
diction of New York. He returned to Nan- 
tucket with his family in 1660, where he lived 
until his death, October 2, 1681, at his new 
residence on the hill at Northam, near Ca- 
paum pond. Tristram Coffyn was thirty-seven 
years of age upon his removal to America 
and fifty-five when he settled in Nantucket. 
Joan, his mother, died in Boston, May, 1661, 
aged seventy-seven years, "a woman of extra- 
ordinary character." Of his two sisters who 
came to America with him, Eunice married 
William Butler, Mary married Alexander 
Adams. Three of his children, Peter, Tris- 
tram (2), and Elizabeth, were inarried at 
the time of the removal to Nantucket. 

Tristram Coffyn was the leading spirit 
among the early islanders, and the large fam- 
ily interest gave him power to control in a 
great measure the enterprises of the island. 
During the first years he was the richest pro- 
jirietor except his son Peter, who possessed 
a large estate. He was very generous, public- 
sjjirited, and did not seek his own advantage 
in an unreasonable degree. He assisted in de- 
veloping the resources of the island, was 
friendly with the Indians and had great influ- 
ence over them. The first general court for 
Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard was com- 
prised of Tristram Coffyn, first chief magis- 
trate of Nantucket; Thomas Mayhevv, first 
chief magistrate of Martha's Vineyard, and 
two associates from each island. At their 
first session a law prohibiting the sale of in- 



toxicants to the Indians was passed. This 
is probably the first prohibitory law on record. 
His commission as chief magistrate of the isl- 
and bears date of June 29, 1671, and is signed 
by Governor Lovelace of New York. While 
he was reputed to be quite wealthy in goods 
and lands, owning together with his son one- 
fourth of the island of Nantucket and all of 
Tuckernuck island, he did not die rich. He 
made no will, but disposed of much of his 
land while he lived, by deeds, the consideration 
being, "regard and natural affection." Most 
of the remainder of his estate he deeded to his 
two youngest sons, John and Stephen, they to 
take possession after the death of Tristram 
and his wife. To each of his grandchildren 
he gave ten acres upon the island of Tuck- 
ernuck or to such of them "as would plant 
it." He was a man of strict integrity and 
generous kindly nature. He was buried in 
Nantucket, probably upon his own estate. His 
wife survived him and was tenderly cared for 
by her large family of children and grand- 
children.

woman, participating in the public gatherings 
and town meetings, where her words were 
listened to with marked respect ; she antici- 
pated the Woman's Rights and Suffragette 
movement by more than two centuries ; she 
was consulted upon all matters of public im- 
portance because her judgment was superior, 
and as the Rev. John Richardson says: "The 
Islanders esteemed her as a judge among 
them, for little of moment was done without 
her:" in town meetings she took an active 
part in debates, usually commencing her re- 
marks with: "My husband thinks" or "My 
Inisband and I, having considered the subject, 
think :" she was possessed of sound judgment, 
clear understanding, an eloquent, easy and 
natural mode of expression: in 1701, at the 
age of fifty-six, she became interested in the 
religious faith of the Society of Friends or 
Quakers, and took the spiritual concern of the 
whole island under her care : she held meet- 
ings at her own house, wrote the quarterly 
■epistles and preached in a most eloquent and 
impressive manner and withal was as noted 
for her good housekeeping as for her ability 
as a preacher : says the same Rev. John Rich- 
ardson : "The order of her house was such in 
all the parts thereof, as I had not seen the 
like before :" she was the mother of ten chil- 
dren. 8. Lieutenant John, born in Haverhill :

Gillett is the surname from 

GILLETT Guillot, the French diminutive 
for William. The family may 
have come with William the Conqueror into 
England from Gillette, a town in Piedmont, 
France. Gillette, the son of Giles. (Arthur's 
"Dictionary of Family and Christian Names," 
1857, p. 140.) Another authority says Gillet 
(in pronunciation Jillet). The name is sup- 
posed to be derived from Gilleste. a town on 
the borders of France and Piedmont. When 
the "g" is hard, the name is probably a deriva- 
tion of Gillaume, William. (Sower's "Patro- 
nymica Brittanica," i860, p. 128.) According 
to Guppy. in his "Homes of Family Names, 
1890." the name Gillett is now found chiefly 
in Oxfordshire, with a small representation in 
Kent and Somersetshire. In Lincolnshire it 
is found changed to Gilliart and Gillyett. In 
the thirteenth century the name took the 
forms in Cambridgeshire and Huntingdon- 
shire of Gillot, Giilote and Gilot. Gillett. 
French, Gillot, French Huguenot. ("British 
Family Names," Barber, 1894, p. 131.) 

"Burke's General .A.rmory," 1878, p. 400, 
noted the following grants of arms, omitting 
the date except in one instance : Gillet, alias 
Chandler (Ipswich, county Suffolk). .Arms: 
Ermine on a bend engrailed sable, three lucies 
heads erased or, collared with a bar genel gu. 
Crest: A lucy's head erased and erect, gu. 
Gillet, or Gillot (Broadfield, county Norfolk). 
Arms, same as above, lucies, heads or. Crest:

is probably explained by "A Roll of Arms, 
1673," contributed by .Arthur Schomberg to 
"The Genealogist," new series, 24: 261. On 
this roll appears "Gillett, Phillip, alias Chand- 
ler, of Woodbridge, gent." Arms: Ermine,

and Peter; and two daughters, Maude and 
Margaret ; both daughters and Peter are under 
tutors. He had two wives, Katherine and 
"Dame Mawde," who survived him. The sec- 
ond wife, Maude, was a daughter of Sir 
Henry Vavasor, of York (Harleian Society 
Publications. 16:330). 

Peter Gilliott, citizen and merchant of the 
city of York, made his will in July, 1525, men- 
tioning his wife Alicia and daughter Matilda ; 
his brother's children, Robert and Maude, and 
other people not so nearly connected. (As the 
foregoing is published as a footnote to Sir 
John's will, it is to be supposed they were 
father and son. The inference is that Peter 
had no son. The male lines then have been 
continued, if at all, by Lawrence or William, 
one of whom was the father of Robert, alive 
in 1525.) 

Maude Gilliott, daughter and heir of Sir 
John Gilliott, Knight, mayor of the city of 
York, married John Langholme. (Langholme 
pedigree from Visitation of Lincolnshire, pub- 
lished in the "Genealogist," old series, 4: 187.) 
Sir Thomas Gilliott, of York, Knight, 1460, 
who married Martha, daughter of Sir Henry 
Vavasor, of Haselwood, high sheriff of York- 
shire (10 Ed. IV), may have been an ances- 
tor of Sir John, previously mentioned. Sir 
Henry \'avasor died 1460. (Betham's Bar- 
onetage, 1 : 356. This work is not, however, 
responsible for the suggestion of kinship be- 
tween Sir Thomas and Sir John.) 

Catherine, daughter and heiress of Peter 
Gilliot, of Broughton, married Roger, sec- 
ond son of Sir Richard Tempest. Living 
temp. Hen. VH. (Betham's Baronetage, 2: 
346.) In Visitation of Yorkshire, 1584-85, p. 
293, it is stated that Roger Tempest, of 
Broughton, married a daughter of Sir Piers 
Gilliot, whose wife was the daughter and 

heiress of Thorpe. 

Robert Gillett, of Thorp Arch, had a daugh- 
ter Isabel who married Matthew Usher, of 
Featherstone ; their son Robert Usher was 
seventeen years old in 1585. (Yorkshire 
Visitations, 1584-85 and 1612, p. 350.) 

Administration on the estate of Richard Gil- 
lott, of Treston, was granted December 17, 
1656, to his widow Mary (Yorkshire Archjeo- 
logical Asso. Rec, ser. i: 166). 

Thomas Gillott, of Brighton See, parish of 
Bradfield, left a will, dated May 28, 1640, and 
proved in August, 1641. (Same 4) Visi- 
tation Yorkshire, 1653-54. (Harleian Society 
Publications, 16:315) show that Roger Tem- 
pest, above mentioned, and his wife, daughter 
and heiress of Pyers Gyllot, Knight, had 
great-grandchildren then living. (The an- 
nalist quaintly remarks that the jjcdigree docs 



not show whether Roger and his wife were 
in this world or the ne.xt. )

The Ashtons of Saratoga, New 
.\SHTON York, descend from Major 

James Ashton, born in Ireland 
about the year 1728. His wife Elizabeth was 
also of Irish birth and parentage. James had 
a brother, Thomas .Ashton, who with wife, 
Elizabeth, was the first of the Ashtons to settle 
in Washington county. New- York. Thomas 
Ashton came to America in 1769 and settled 
in what is now White Creek, Washington 
county. He cleared a farm from the wilder- 
ness and became a founder and a leader of 
the Methodist church. Both Thomas and 
Elizabeth were noted for their devoted piety 
and exerted a wide influence for good, adding 
greatly to the strength and usefulness of their 
church in Washington county. They died 
without issue. In 1772 James .\shton, wife 
Elizabeth, and children, Rebecca, John, Mar- 
garet, with a relative, Thomas Gee Ashton, 
then seventeen years, left Ireland and came 
to the colonies and settled at Ash Grove, now 
in the town of White Creek, Washington 
county. New York, where he purchased land 
adjoining his brother, Thomas Ashton. who 
had preceeded him by three years. No doubt 
he was influenced by his brother in making 
settlement. He became locally prominent in

the town, was active in town and church and 
warmly espoused the cause of the colonies in 
their struggle for independence. It is related 
that he was a member of the "Vigilance Com- 
mittee" that kept watch over the doings of the 
Tories in their locality and that he was the 
recognized leader, dealing at times quite 
Tiarshly with those who were disposed to side 
•with the King. Needing some information 
that he thought a Tory neighbor could but 
-would not give him, James threatened to hang 
Tiim if he did not reveal the needed facts. The 
Tory was stubborn and neither gave the de- 
sired information nor did he hang, but es- 
caped to the British camp at Stillwater. Soon 
after James Ashton was captured by the In- 
dians who brought him to the British camp in 
a badly battered condition. His Tory neigh- 
tor saw him and successfully interceded with 
General Burgoyne to have him kindly treated. 
This "heaping of coals of fire" upon his head 
caused the sturdy patriot to have a more 
"kindly feeling for Tories ever afterward. Dur- 
ing the progress of the battle of Saratoga he 
was confined in a building near by, but soon 
after the retreat of the British he was re- 
leased and returned home. His service to the 
revolutionary cause must have been valuable, 
as on April 4, 1778. Governor Clinton issued 
him a major's commission: "We reposing es- 
pecial trust and confidence as well in your 
patriotism, conduct and loyalty as in your 
valor and readiness to do us good and faith- 
ful service." "With the advice and consent of 
our said Council of Appointment at Pough- 
keepsie, do appoint and constitute you the said 
James Ashton, First Major of the Regiment 
of Militia in the county of .Albany, whereof 
Lewis \'an Woert, esquire, is Colonel." Passed 
the secretary's office, July 4, 1778, by his ex- 
cellency's command. Abraham B. Banker, sec- 
retary. He probably held a lower rank in 
the volunteer army, although there is no rec- 
ord of rank or service in battle. He was a 
member of the Associate Reformed church, as 
was his wife, two daughters and their hus- 
bands. The meeting house was on the "Old 
Turnpike." near the "Old Graveyard." Major 
Ashton died October 9, 1802, in his seventy- 
third year. 

His wife. Elizabeth Ashton, died Novem- 
ber I, 1809, in her eighty-first year. Chil- 
dren: Rebekah, born in Ireland about 1760, 
died January 6, 1804; married her cousin, 
George Barbar (second wife) : he died June 
14, 1832, in his seventy-ninth year; they left 
numerous descendants : John, of whom fur- 
ther ; Margaret, born in Ireland about 1765, 
died June 14. 1841, aged seventy-six years; 
married William \'an Kirk, from New Jersey, 



born of Dutch parents ; he died September 7, 
1836, aged seventy-five years. 

Thomas Gee Ashton, the relative who came 
from Ireland with Major .Ashton, married 
Amity Pierce, of that vicinity. He died Au- 
gust 2. 1840, in his eighty-eighth year. She 
died August 18, 1830, in her sixty-seventh 
year. They have many descendants. He 
served in the war of the revolution and was 
a pensioner. Thomas Gee Ashton, private in 
the revolutionary war, received "Twenty-one 
Dollars and forty-four cents per annum dur- 
ing his natural life, commencing on the fourth 
of March, 183 1." His revolutionary claim is 
signed, "Lewis Cass." secretary of war. 

(II) John, only son of Major James and 
Elizabeth Ashton, was born in Ireland, July 
8. 1763, died December 8, 1837, on his farm 
in the town of White Creek, Washington 
county. New York. He was nine years of 
age when his parents came to America. His 
after life was spent in agriculture, on the 
White Creek farm, first his father's, later his 
own by inheritance, which contained three 
hundred acres. When a boy he witnessed the 
after scenes of the battle of Saratoga, saw the 
dead buried and said, "They were scattered 
like shocks of wheat in the harvest field." He 
was prosperous, benevolent and charitable, 
giving one-tenth of all his crops to the worthy 
poor of his neighborhood. Of him it was 
written, "He was a man of good judgment 
and sound mind, and for honesty and sincerity 
had no superior." He was a member, with 
his wife and family, of the Associate Re- 
formed church and worshipped at the meeting 
house in Coila. He married Lydia Morford, 
born Monmouth county. New Jersey, died 
February 11, 1841, in her eightieth year. Chil- 
dren : James. John, William, Isaac, Thomas, 
Benjamin, Elizabeth, Rebecca and Sarah. 
There are many descendants of John Ashton.

(Morford) Ashton. was born in the town of 
White Creek, Washington county. New York, 
in 1794. died in the town of Argyle, same 
county, March 21, 1869. He was a farmer all 
his life, which was lived in Washington 
county, and left an honored name behind him. 
He married Elizabeth Stewart, born 1793, died 
October 9, 1869. They had seven children. 

(I\') David B.. sixth child of Thomas and 
Elizabeth (Stewart) .Ashton, was born in 
Argyle, Washington county, December 9, 1824, 
died at Saratoga Springs, New York, May 
23, 1891. He was well educated in local 
schools and learned the trade of carriage 
maker. He established in business in his na- 
tive town and carried on the manufacture of 
wagons and carriages there for many years,

On page 373 it is found that Van Woert was

then being in old Albany county. (These 
records of Captain Caleb and his son Caleb 
have been accepted by the Society D. A. R.

the militia was ordered out : as there was a 
scarcity of ammunition, each man was ordered 
to procure his own as far as possible. Caleb 
removed the weights from the old "grand- 
father's clock," substituting pails of sand, then 



melted and moulded the weights into bullets, 
which he next day fired at the British. The 
old clock is still in the possession of his great- 
grandchildren, a highly prized revolutionary 
relic, and still measures the correct time.

This is a common name in 
WRIGHT New England, and very diffi- 
cult to trace. The family is a 
prominent one in New York also, and has 
furnished many notable men. In 1844 Silas 
\\'right was governor of the state, and in 
the professions there have been many men of 
prominence bearing the name. 

(I) The .\msterdam family descended from 
Matthew Wright, of Connecticut, who was 
born about 1700-07. He was probably of 
Chatham. Whether he was a relative of Dea- 
con Thomas Wright, of Springfield, Massa- 
chusetts, does not appear. Matthew was of 
Welsh descent. He married Esther Lewis, 
also of Connecticut. They removed to New 



York, settling in Otsego county, near Coopers- 
town, where they are buried. He is said to 
have attained the great age of one hundred 
and three, dying in 1810. She died in 1820, at 
the age of ninety. There were over six sol- 
diers served in the revolution from Connecti- 
cut by the name of Wright, but it is not clear 
that any of the eight sons of Matthew were 
among them, although there are some bearing 
the same Christian name. His children were : 
Daniel : John, see forward ; Earl ; Matthew 
(2): Thomas; Ebenezer ; Sallie ; Esther; 
Hepseber ; Ix>uis and two others. 

(II) John, son of Matthew and Esther 
(Lewis) Wright, was probably born in Otsego 
county. New York. He lived to the age of 
sixty. He was married and left a family. His 
children were: John Y.. see forward; Justus, 
Samuel, Fanny, Ebenezer, Jane, and two who 
died in infancy. 

(III) John Y., son of John Wright, was 
bom near Cooperstown, Otsego county. New 
York, and died in Albany county at about the 
age of seventy-five. He married a descendant 
of one of the early Dutch families of .\lbany 
county, who bore him children : i. Justus, died 
in Albany, New York, shortly after his mar- 
riage. 2. Henry, born in Westerlow, Sche- 
nectady county, where he married Jane Liddle, 
of Schenectady county : they settled in Duanes- 
burg, where they died, leaving children: 
Thomas. John. Robert, Henry and Edward. 
3. Charles, see forward. 4. George, died in 
Rochester, New York. 5. Sylvester, veteran 
of civil war ; now residing in Duanesburg. 6. 
Ann. 7. Eliza. 8. Miranda. 

(I\') Charles, son of John Y. Wright, was 
born in Westerlow, Schenectady county. New 
York, July 26, 1820, died in Amsterdam, July 
26, 1893. When a young man he removed 
to Florida, Montgomery county, where he en- 
gaged in agriculture, his lifelong occupation. 
He married Olive C. Fancber, lx>rn August 19, 
1826, died February 3, 1891. She was born 
on the Fancher homestead, settled by one of 
the early families of the town of Florida. 
She was the daughter of Schuyler and Eunice 
Fancher, whose forbears were pioneers of 
Montgomery county. The children of Charles 
and Olive (Fancher) Wright were: i. Schuy- 
ler F., born January 11, 1842, died July 23, 
1907 ; married (first) Laura Parker, who bore 
him a son, George F., now of Amsterdam ; 
(second) Mrs. Alary (Brumley) Van Home, 
who survived him and resides in .-Xmsterdam. 
2. George, see forward. 3. Richard, August 
25, 1847 : a farmer and resides on the old 
Fancher homestead, where his mother was 
born ; married (first) Annie Parks, of Florida, 
who bore him a daughter, Caroline, now

HUDSON AND MOHAWK \-ALLEYS 



wife of Charles McKinney; (second) Rachel 
Padgett ; they have no issue. 4. Caroline, Oc- 
tober 25, 1853 ; married Jesse May, of English 
birth ; they have no issue. 5. Cora Belle, 1862 ; 
married Cornelius V. Williams ; children : 
Olive, Charles W. (2), Ada and Clifton Wil- 
liams, and two who died in infancy. Their 
daughter Olive is married and resides in 
Cleveland, Ohio. It is worthy of note that 
Charles Wright and his wife Olive had a 
married life of over fifty years, the first death 
in the family being that of Mrs. Wright. 

(V) George, son of Charles and Olive 
(Fancher) Wright, was born on the old 
Fancher homestead, December 31, 1843. He 
was educated in the public schools of the 
town, and made the best possible use of his 
opportunities to obtain an education. Hte 
worked on the farm until he was twenty-two 
and then left home and learned the trade of 
carpenter. He was a natural mechanic and 
became an expert workman. In 1868 he 
settled in Amsterdam, and in a few years be- 
gan contracting. He has been very successful 
and is recognized as one of the leading con- 
tractors and builders of the city. He has 
erected some of the largest business buildings 
in the city, notably the Atlas Knitting Mills, 
the Pioneer Broom Factory, the Central 
Hotel, the Pythian Temple, and others of 
equal prominence, as well as many fine private 
residences. In politics Mr. Wright is a Demo- 
crat, and before the city was incorporated was 
assessor of the village for seven years. He 
is connected with the Presbyterian church, as 
is his wife. He holds fraternal relations with 
Woodbine Lodge, No. 250, Knights of Pyth- 
ias. He married, December, 1869, in Amster- 
dam, Julia O. Hart, born 1849, died September 
3, 1870. He married (second) in Canajo- 
harie. New York, March 25, 1875, Mrs. Mary 
(Ellsworth) Collins, born February 21, 1845, 
near Sharon, New York. She is the daugh- 
ter of John and Jedida (Clum) Ellsworth, 
who died at Fort Plain, New York. John 
Ellsworth was a cousin of Colonel E. E. Ells- 
worth, who was one of the first victims of the 
civil war, shot in Alexandria by the owner 
of the house from which Colonel Ellsworth 
had just torn down a Confederate flag. The 
grandfather of John Ellsworth and of Colonel 
Ellsworth was George Ellsworth, of English 
descent. He was a resident of Half Moon, 
Saratoga county, before the revolution ; when 
Burgoyne invaded the territory he joined the 
continental army, though only fifteen. He was 
at the Itattle of Ikinis Heights and at the 
surrender of Burgoyne. He married Sarah 
Reynolds, who bore him fourteen children, one 
of whom was John, father of Mrs. George 



Wright; another, Ephraim D., father of Colo- 
nel Ellsworth, was a captain in the ordnance 
department during the civil war. He had an- 
other son killed in the war. Colonel Ells- 
worth was born in Malta, Saratoga county. 
New York, April 11, 1837. He went west 
and studied law with President Abraham Lin- 
coln, who was ever afterward his warm friend 
and sincerely mourned his tragic death. He 
was colonel of the First New York Zouaves, 
who instantly avenged his death. By her 
former marriage, Mrs. George Wright has a 
daughter, Emma J. (Collins) Watson, born 
June 8, 1870, wife of A. R. Watson, a flour 
and feed merchant of Amsterdam. They have 
Grace and George W. Watson. Mr. and Mrs. 
George Wright have a daughter, Grace Cora, 
born May 29, 1876; she married Clarence D. 
Dean, a commission merchant of Amsterdam, 
and has a son, Charles D. Dean, born May 
27, 1895. Clarence D. Dean is a son of 
Cliarles D. and Melissa (DeGraff) Dean. 



Henry Wright was born in the 
WRIGHT town of Wright, Schoharie 

county, New York, November 
30, 1833. He was the son of Tunis and Mary 
(Ketchem) Wright. He was the oldest child, 
and was but twelve years old when his mother 
died and the home was broken up. From 
that time forward he was obliged to support 
himself, never receiving a dollar's help from 
anyone. At the age of eighteen, while living 
at Gallupville, he was converted and joined 
the Methodist Episcopal church. Soon after 
he felt that he was called of God to the work 
of the ministry. There was at that time no 
fund in the Methodist church to aid young 
men in obtaining an education, but in 1862, 
after much hard work and rigid economy, he 
graduated with honor from Union College and 
in the same year joined the Troy conference. 
His first appointment was Wcstbush and 
Pleasant Square. Among his parishoners at 
Westbush was Miss Mary Elizabeth Shutts, 
who, on October 11, 1863, became his wife. 
They were married in the little church at 
Westbush on quarterly meeting day by the 
presiding elder. Dr. William Griffin. Many a 
time during the thirty-one years of his married 
life did he congratulate himself on having 
chosen so capable a helpmeet. For, with the 
meager salary of a Methodist preacher and a 
family of five children to be fed, clothed and 
educated, there was need of a wise manager, 
and such Mrs. Wright proved herself to be. 
The rule of the Methodist Episcopal church 
at that time permitted a pastor to serve a 
charge but two years, though the limit was 
soon after extended to three years. During 



HUDSON AND MOHA*WK VALLEYS 



the thirty-two years of his ministry Mr. 
Wright served fifteen different charges, in 
Fulton, Montgomery, Albany, Schoharie, 
Rensselaer. Warren, Washington and Saratoga 
counties, and at Stamford, Vermont. On 
some of them the work was laborious and diffi- 
cult, but every appointment was received as 
from the Lord, and with simple faith and 
lofty courage he performed with untiring 
faithfulness every duty. By his sweetness of 
spirit, gentle courtesy and sterling integrity 
he won the love of many and the respect of 
all. On some of his charges there were large 
revivals, and during every pastorate some were 
added to the church. He loved music, had a 
good voice, and in the absence of chorister or 
choir could lead the congregation in singing. 
He was never at a loss for an appropriate 
hymn, for his memory was well stored with 
the good old hymns of the church. An ardent 
temperance advocate, he sometimes incurred 
the wrath of the rumseller and his friends. He 
believed that religion and politics could be 
mixed without harm to either, and though it 
cost him a struggle to leave the ranks of the 
Republicans, some years before his death he 
became a third party Prohibitionist. A sunny 
disposition enabled him to enjoy to the full the 
simplest pleasures. The care of a garden, his 
horse and a few hens was his usual recreation, 
and an occasional fishing trip his extraordinary 
delight. Nowhere was he happier than in his 
own home. His son and his daughters were 
his greatest earthly treasures. Knowing that 
he could leave them little of material wealth, 
he sought to train them to habits of industry 
and self-reliance, and to give them the be.st 
education his limited means would allow. He 
lived to see his eldest daughter and his son 
graduate with honor from Syracuse Univer- 
sity, and his second daughter from the State 
Normal College at .Albany. These children, 
when they had finished their school days, be- 
gan planning a home for father and mother 
when he should be old and no longer able to 
preach. A lot was bought in Gloversville that 
the mother might be near her relatives and 
the house was in process of building when the 
father was called to the Heavenly Home. 
Never in all his life had he had any protracted 
illness, and he had no experience of the in- 
firmities of age. His hair had become snowy 
white and was indeed "a crown of glory," but 
he was almost in his usual health when in the 
midst of his work God called him home. He 
died December 27, 1894, at Clifton Park, 
Saratoga County, and was buried in Prospect 
Hill cemetery, Gloversville. Children of Rev.

The Stevens family is of Eng- 
STEVENS lish origin and in 1620 were 

living in Cornwall and Berk- 
shire counties, England. Nathaniel Gove 
Stevens, born September 14, 1786. is de- 
scended from a member of this family who 
emigrated to .\mcrica and was one of the first 
settlers in Warwick, Massachusetts. His 
father, also nained Nathaniel Gove Stev- 
ens, was born April 7, 1752; married 
Lois Stowe, of Marlboro, Massachusetts, 
born 1752, died 1813; children as fol- 



lows : Lois, Abel. .Simon, Anna, Nathaniel 
Gove, Jr., Samuel. Besides being a prosper- 
ous farmer, Nathaniel Gove, Jr., successfully 
managed a saw mill and tan yard. He rafted 
lumber down the Connecticut river. In re- 
ligion he was a Unitarian. He married Nancy 
Stoughton. Children : Nathaniel Edwin. Sarah, 
married a Mr. McClenathan, Lois C, Charles, 
Mariah, Timothy Gilbert, Samuel Stoughton. 

(II) Samuel Stoughton, son of Nathaniel 
Gove and Nancy (Stoughton) Stevens, was 
born at Warwick, Franklin county, Massachu- 
setts, August 25, 1829. He acquired his edu- 
cation in the schools of his native village. In 
1848 he went on a raft to South Hadley Falls. 
He journeyed from there to Hartford, Con- 
necticut, and other places, seeking a shop to 
learn the machinists' trade. In Worcester, 
Massachusetts, he engaged with the firm of 
Goddard & Rice, tool makers, and manufactur- 
ers of paper machinery, his only remuneration 
being board and lodging. He remained until 
the expiration of his apprenticeship, when he 
accepted a position with Severance & Tourt- 
lotte. who with others, had established a works 
for building paper machinery, taking the posi- 
tion of foreman. He remained with this firm 
three years in Hartford, Connecticut. From 
there he went to Troy, New York, to set 
up a machine which he had superintended in 
building for A. W. Orr & Company, with 
whom he remained five years. In 1858, in 
connection with the Orrs. he purchased the 
North Hoosick mill, which had been partly 
fitted up for making wrapping paper. He 
completed this mill to make hanging paper, 
and in a short time brought the production 
from one ton per day to that of two tons. 
He remained with the Orrs for about twelve 
years. In 1869, after the death of .Alexander 
Orr and William O. Cunningham, he, with 
George S. Thomjjson, bought out the interest 
of the Orrs and continued the business under 
the firm name of Stevens & Thompson. In 
1874 Stevens & Thompson in connection with 
R. H. Thompson, leased the Walloomsac Pa- 
per Mill, formerly owned and managed by 
Austin and Pratt. .After running this mill for 
a term of six years they purchased the prop- 
erty from Henry Smith, of New York, and 
immediately commenced enlarging the plant. 
This in connection with the North Hoosick 
mill brought the production up to considerable 
over twenty tons per day. 

Mr. .Stevens, assisted by his .son Frank L. 
Stevens, had exclusive charge of the me- 
chanical departments. He had made several 
valuable inventions for which he had secured 
patents. The first, for a continuous process of 
the treatment of paper stock in the form of old 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS

papers, by which the stock is not handled from 
the time it is put into the duster until it comes 
out on the machine in the form of paper. 
Another is a variable speed device for paper 
machines. His third invention is a centrifugal 
continuous process pulp dryer. In recent 
years he had introduced into this line several 
specialities of paper, the manufacturing of 
which his younger son, Fred N. Stevens, has 
full charge. Samuel S. Stevens married 
Marcia Maria Lamberton, of Ware, Massa- 
chusetts, daughter of Gideon Lamberton, born 
in Ware, 1798, died at the same place in 
1892. He was a prosperous farmer, a Re- 
publican in politics and a member of the Pres- 
byterian church. He married in Ware and 
had three children: i. Alfred, born in Ware, 
died in Oregon, not married. 2. Melzar, died 
in Gilbertville, Massachusetts, married and had 
two children : i. Walter, died at age of twenty-

(HI) Captain Frank Lamberton, eldest son 
of Samuel Stoughton and Marcia Maria 
(Lamberton) Stevens, was born October 28, 
1864. He was educated at the Worcester 
Polytechnic Institute, and early began his ca- 
reer in the paper making industry. He en- 
tered the mills of Stevens & Thompson in 
1884, and continued until the incorporation in 
1903, when he was elected vice-president, an 
office wliich he still holds. He is also vice- 
president of the Walloomsac Paper Company, 
a corporation in which he has been interested 
since 1900, when he purchased in connection 
with his brother, Fred N., the interest former- 
ly held by his father, Samuel Stoughton Ste- 
vens. I'rank L. has always been closely asso- 
ciated with the practical side of paper making, 
and was his father's assistant in the exclusive 
charge of the mechanical department of the 
mills. To a thoroughly practical knowledge 
of paper making he adds executive ability of 
a liigh order, which is recognized by his as.so- 
ciates in the various corporations in which he 
holds official positions. He is president of the 
Noble &- Wood Machine Company, of Hoo- 
sick Falls, New York ; vice-president of The 



Stevens & Thompson Paper Company of Mid- 
dle Falls, New York, and a director of the 
First National Bank, Hoosick Falls, New 
York. He served in the National Guard, 
New York, and during the Spanish-American 
war was captain in the Second Regiment of 
Infantry. He was captain of the Thirty-sec- 
ond Separate Company, New York National 
Guard, with which he had served sixteen 
years. He is a Repul^lican in politics and 
in 1904-05 represented his district in the New 
York State assembly. Mr. Stevens is a mem- 
ber of Van Rensselaer Lodge, No. 400, Free 
and Accepted ]\Iasons, of Hoosick Falls, New 
York; Raymond Chapter, No. 248, Royal

20, 1884. Frederica, daughter of Joseph Carl 
and Katherine (Schaffer) Wallich, of Detroit, 
Michigan. Joseph Carl Wallich was born at 
Trier-on-the-Rhine, Germany, in 1833. He 
learned the trade of cabinetmaker, which then 
included pianos and weaving machinery, the 
latter an important branch. He came to the 
United States in 185 1, locating first at Cleve- 
land, later in Berea, Ohio. During the civil 
war he was selected as carpenter to an engi- 
neering corps, his ability in construction being 
well known to the officer in charge. In 1862 
he settled in Detroit, where he purchased a 
residence, now 405 Cass avenue, then far in 
the country surrounded by woods. He be- 
came a prominent contractor and builder, com- 
pleting several important government contracts 
including the post office and Marine Hospital 
buildings. He was deeply interested in the 
study of anthropology and was deeply versed 
in his favorite study. He was a .source of 
wonder to the professional men with whom he 
conversed. His last words expressed his life 
ambition "Ein guter erieirchterungs sim." (A 
good, well-enlightened perception.) He was 
at different times a member of the Concor- 
dia and Harmonic Singing Societies, and was 
affiliated with Zion Lodge, No. i. Free and

promoted to assistant superintendent. He 
owns and runs a farm of one hundred and 
fifty acres which he bought in 1906. It is his- 
toric ground, being land on which the first

E. W'atkins, by whom he had one son, Wil-

riage he worked at his trade a while in Paw- 
tucket. Rhode Island, where some of his chil- 
dren were born. He returned to Walpole 
and purchased the Robinson tavern stand and 
commenced keeping a public house in 1837. in 
which business he continued till the building 
of the Cheshire railroad, when the tavern 
keeping was relinquished. When he com- 
menced keeping tavern there was a large 
amount of travel over the road that passed 
his house, it being the third New Hampshire 
turnpike. liere. he and his wife did their best 
to please, thereby securing a good share of 
customers, who were sure to be well cared

1719, leaving twins three days old. He mar- 
ried (second) June 28. 1722, Mary Brook. 
He deeded lands in New Hartford in 1744 
and 1745. We find in Norfolk records, deeds 
July 2, 1772, from "Joshua the elder to son 
Joshua." Also be bought lands in Norfolk 
in 1769. He died February 6, 1773, of an 
eating cancer of the mouth, aged about eigh-

(V) Joshua (2), son of Joshua (i) Moses,

1769, "Joshua Moses of Simsbury bouglit 
land in Norfolk of Matthew Phelps." Also 
a deed July 2, 1772, from "Joshua the elder 
to son Joshua." In the distribution of the 
estate of Joshua Moses, November 4. 1795, 
Norfolk. Pro. Rec. mention is made of wife 
.Abigail and the reservation of a "shop" to 
Jonathan ; then further distribution is made

to Joshua, Thomas, Jonathan, Abigail Pahner 
and Jesse Moses and "heirs of Joshua." Pre- 
vious to this are recorded several deeds No- 
vember 30, 1792, for "love and good will" 
to "son Jesse" "son Thomas," "son Joshua 
Jr.," and September 17, 1794, to Jesse Moses 
from "his honored father." It seems a little 
singular that a son Jonah was left out of 
this distribution as we find in Norfolk records 
this entry: "Jonah Moses, son of Joshua 
Moses and Abigail, his wife, born October 
25, 1777." In the history of the Terry fam- 
ily, we learn that Abigail Terry, born Janu- 
ary 18, 1740, married Joshua Moses, of Nor- 
folk.

large practice as a physician at Hoosick Falls, 
New York. An interesting letter from him 
is published in the History of Norfolk, Con- 
necticut. He was a zealous churchman, read- 
ing service for several years in the school 
house, until funds were provided to build 
the present St. Mark's Episcopal Church at 
Hoosick Falls. He married, February 18,

Among the Dukes of Aus- 
ALBRIGHT tria between 976 and 1493 

was Albrecht II, who 
reigned as Margrave of Austria and Duke 
of Bavaria in the year 1139. He died with- 
out posterity. In 1282 Albrecht III, Duke 
of Austria, reigned as Albrecht I. Emperor 
of Roman Germany. He was born in 1248, 
and assassinated in 1308. .'\lbrecht II (The 
Wise) reigned as Duke of Austria, 1330-58. 
He married, and was succeeded by his son, 



Rudolph I\', who was succeeded by Al- 
brecht III (the astrologer), his brother, whcx 
reigned 1365-95. He married Elizabeth, 
daughter of Karl IV, German Roman Em- 
peror, who died in 1373. He married (sec- 
ond) Beatrixe, daughter of Friederich IV^ 
of Nurmberg. He was succeeded by his only 
son, Albrecht IV, who reigned 1395-1404. 
He married Johanna, daughter of Albert,. 
Count of Holland and Duke of Bavaria. Al- 
brecht V succeeded his father, and reigned 
Duke of Austria, 1402. King of Hungary, 
King of Bohemia and German Roman Em- 
peror, as Albrecht II, 1438-39, when he died. 
Six dukes of Austria now reigned until an- 
other Albrecht came to the throne. In 1475 
Albrecht VI, born 1418, died 1463, came to 
the throne and reigned Count of Tyrol and' 
Duke of Austria 1457-63. In 1493 this par- 
ticular title seems to have become extinct 
with Maximillian. the First. It is from this 
line of Austrain dukes that Heinric Albrecht 
descended. The name in America has be- 
come Hendrick Albright, but the family name 
is Albrecht, and the given name Heinrich. 
The family were noble for centuries, and the 
emigrant to America was a man of means 
and education. The family everywhere that 
descend from this ancestor show the effects 
of those centuries of high breeding, and are 
distinguished in their several walks, inclin- 
ing largely to the professions, particularly the 
pulpit and music. In the L^nited States the 
name is a very familiar one, and has been 
given wide prominence by Rev. Jacob Al- 
bright, born near Pottsville, Pennsylvania, of 
German parentage, who became an exhorter 
and noted Methodist minister. He made 
many converts, almost exclusively Germans, 
and in 1800 a separate church was organized, 
Albright being first presiding elder. He was- 
appointed bishop in 1807. His denomination 
is now known as the "Evangelical Associa- 
tion," but in many places its adherents are 
called ".Albrights." 

(I) The American progenitor of the Al- 
bright family of \'oorheesville, .•\lbany coun- 
ty. New York, is Hendrick Albright, borrr 
in .Austria in 1716, and came to America 
in 1740. He was a man of means, as im- 
mediately upon his arrival he purchased four 
hundred acres of the best land in Guilder- 
land. Albany county, now tlie town of New 
Scotland. He married Elizabeth Folent (Po- 
land), and on their Guilderland farm, in 1783, 
he built the original stone house that was 
the family home for several generations, and' 
stood in good repair until destroyed by fire 
in 1894. He was an ardent revolutionist, and' 
so deep was his hatred of a Tory that it is

said he ordered his son-in-law, 



Strauss 



(who had joined the British army during the 
revohition), to quit not only the farm and 
neighborhood, but to leave the country. Al- 
though this was after the war had closed, 
Strauss was so impressed with the old man's 
warnings that he removed to Canada, where 
he remained until his death. Part of the 
original purchase of four hundred acres, 
which was divided among the four sons, has 
always remained in the Albright family. His 
wife Elizabeth was of Scotch birth and an- 
cestry. Children : John, baptized August 6, 
1749; married and had issue: Jacob, Hannah,

(H) Jacob, son of Hendrick and Elizabeth 
(Poland) Albright, was born in Guilderland, 
Albany county, New York (now New Scot- 
land), baptized October 11, 1763, died March 
20, 1829. He inherited part of the paternal 
acres, and was engaged in their cultivation 
all his active years. He was a Whig in poli- 
tics, and a member of the Dutch Reformed 
church. He married (first) Hannah Arnold ; 
(second) Elizabeth Wheeler, born and reared 
on the Albright home farm. Children by first

January 11, 1797, died January 20, 1888. He 
was a continuous resident of the original 
homestead farm until his death at the age 
of ninety-two years. He became the owner 
of that portion left to his father, and added 
many improvements. He was a faithful mem- 
ber of the Reformed church of New Salem, 



and never missed a service until a few weeks 
before his death, unless kept away by sick- 
ness or unavoidable detention. He was free 
from the bigotry of his day, called all Chris- 
tians his brethren, and was a friend to all 
those persecuted for conscience sake. He was 
a strong Democrat, as had been his father 
and grandfather. His last vote was cast for 
the same party as his first had been. 
He was prosperous in worldly affairs, 
and gave to each of his sons a good 
farm. He married, September 9, 1820, 
Cicely, born November 4, 1801, died 
December 29, 1885, daughter of Peter Sim-

There is historic propriety in 
GILBERT preserving the memory of the 

services and name of Gilbert, 
as no one is more honorably or intimately con- 
nected with American discoveries and early 
history. It stands conspicuous among such 
names as Raleigh, Drake and Cavendish, to 
whom the Gilberts were joined by lineage. 
The name is Saxon, and is written in the Roll 
of Battle Abbey and in the Book of Domes- 
day. Richard Fitz-Gilbert was a kinsman 
of the Conqueror. Sir Humphrey Gilbert 
devoted his life to geographical discovery, 
principally in North America. He was the 
first Englishman who projected settlements 
in America, in attempting which he lost his 
life. He projected the settlemenb, later per- 
fected by Sir Walter Raleigh. These men 
laid the foundations of the trade and naval 
power of Great Britain. Sir Humphrey was 
also an eminent scientific authority in 
"Computation astronomical and cosmograph- 
ical" and "a man both valiant and experienced 
in martial affairs." In 1758 Queen Elizabeth 
: granted letters patent to Sir Humphrey "to 



discover and take possession of all remote 
and barbarous lands, unoccupied by any 
Christian prince or people." On August 5, 
1582, "he took Seizen of New Foundland 
and the adjacent territories for the Crown of 
England." The Gilberts of New England 
came from Devonshire, England. They set- 
tled in Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut and 
Maryland, some of the name also going to 
Mrginia. 

(I) John Gilbert was at Dorchester, Mas- 
sachusetts, as early as 1636. About 1640 
four brothers, Jonathan, Thomas, Obadiah, 
and Josiah Gilbert, were living in Connecti- 
cut. Matthew Gilbert, one of the first col- 
onists of New HavSn, was the progenitor 
of the Gilbert families of Hamden. Connec- 
ticut. He is numbered among the first prin- 
cipal settlers of New Haven. He was one 
of the persons chosen in 1639 for the seven 
pillars of the church and one of the first 
magistrates of the colony and deputy-gover- 
nor. He left two sons, Matthew and Samuel. 

(II) Matthew, son of Governor John Gil- 
bert, died in 171 1, leaving a son, Daniel. 

(HI) Daniel, .son of Matthew Gilbert, died 
in 1753. He was a settler in that part of 
New Haven called Hamden. He left five 
sons, Matthew, Solomon, Michael, Caleb and 
John. Michael and John were killed when 
the British troops invaded New Haven, July 
5- I779- John was captain of the Uptown 
militia. He met the Briti.sh troops at the 
head of his company and was killed with five 
of his men. 

(IV) Captain John was the grandfather 
of William and the progenitor of the Albany 
county Gilberts. 

(V) A son of Captain John Gilbert, (record 
wanting). 

(VI) William, grandson of Captain John 
Gilbert, of New Haven. Connecticut, was born

followed the life of a farmer. He served 
in the American army during the war of 
1812. He was a Whig in politics. He mar- 
ried (first) Ora Hart, daughter of one of 
the early families of the town. Children : 
Glazie, Noah, Elkanah, Maria, Laura, Ann,

liam (2) Gilbert, was the last survivor of the

(Vni) Henry Smith, only son and child 
of William (2) ancl Hannah (Houghton) 
Gilbert, was born near the village of New 
Salem, town of New Scotland, Albany county, 
New York, March 5. 1846. He was educated 
in the public schools and rapidly developed 
a strong, robust physique. His early interest 
in political life was shown when at the semi- 
centennial of old Fremont political veteran's 
reunion at Saratoga, New York, in 1906, 
he was an invited guest, and won a badge 
made especially for the occasion. Among his 
treasures is the badge that was worn on that 
occasion. He remained with his father until 
the latter's death. He inherited the home- 
stead in Glenville which he sold in spring of 
1874, and purchased his present one hundred 
acre estate at Fullers, to which he removed 
in 1875. His specialties are fine horses and 
cows and dairy farming. In 1889-90 he en- 
gaged in mercantile life at Fullers where he 
was also postmaster, holding the office under 
President Harrison. Not finding merchan- 
dising a congenial business, he disposed of 
his store interest and returned to his farm. 
He has been actively engaged in the sale of 
agricultural machinery for many years, and 
is director, stockholder and vice-president of 
the Altamont Driving Park and Fair Asso- 
ciation, also a prominent exhibitor. From 
the days of the organization of the Repub- 
lican party he has retained the liveliest inter- 
est in political life. To his early education 
he has added from wide experience and well- 
chosen reading, and has risen to the front 
rank as a leader in his town party. He is 
a pleasing, forceful speaker, and at county and' 
state conventions is often heard. He im- 
presses his audience with his sound, clear 
reasoning and earnestness. He fights all his 
battles in the open, and is intensely loyal to- 
party mandates as expressed in convention. 
He is one of the Old Guard, but never uses 
the knife to revenge convention defeats. He 
is truly a "lifelong" Republican. He is a 
member and a liberal supporter of the Metho- 
dist church of Guilderland. Mr. Gilbert is 
decidedly temperate in his tastes, never having 
tasted any kind of liquor and smoking but" 
little. He married, January 6, 1867, in Glen- 
ville, Schenectady county, Helen C, Weaver, 
born November 12. 1850, daughter of Ben- 
jamin and Hannah (Closson) Weaver. Chil-

"Jeremiah Wood was married 
WOOD unto Dority Benett the 29th 

March 1709," is the first record 
found of the progenitor of the Wood family 
of Hoosick Falls, New York, herein recorded. 
This record is found in Lyme town records. 
Vol. 2, page 354. According to the tomb- 
stone record of Jeremiah Wood he was born 
in May, 1678. "Dorete" Benett was born 
May 16, 1688. While the parentage of Jere- 
miah can be traced no further, we find that 
his wife, Dorothy, was the granddaughter 
of Henry Champion, who was born in Eng- 
land in 161 1. He came to New England and 
was one of the first settlers of Saybrook and 
East Saybrook (Lyme), Connecticut. He 
married and had five children, the eldest of 
whom was "Saraw" (Sarah), born in 1649. 
Herriman, in his "Early Puritan Settlers of 
Connecticut," says: "Few families in the 
Connecticut Colony have been more pros- 
pered than that of Henry Champion." His 
descendants bore an important part in the 
revolution, among them Colonel Henry and 
General Epaphroditus Champion. Henry 
Champion removed to Lyme many years be- 
fore his death at great age, February 17, 



1708. The papers concerning the final set- 
tlement of the estate are on file at the pro- 
bate office, New London, Connecticut. Among 
the heirs who signed a paper declaring them- 
selves satisfied with the distribution of the 
estate, is "Henry Benet." 

Sarah Champion, eldest daughter of 
Henry Champion, married Henry Benett. De- 
cember 9, 1673. He died in 1726, leaving 
three sons, and four married daughters. 
"Dorete," the sixth child and fourth daugh- 
ter, was born May 19, 1688. A "Deed of 
Gift" to his daughter "Dorathy" is found 
among the papers of her husband. 

(I) Jeremiah Wood, the American an- 
cestor, married Dorothy (as the name came 
to be spelled) Benett, March 29, 1709. He 
lived in Stow, Massachusetts, where his first 
four children were born ; the other eight were 
born in Littleton, Massachusetts, which may 
mean that the establishing of the boundaries 
of the town threw his residence in Little- 
ton. The birth of his daughter Luce is re- 
corded in Stow, the birth of the next in Lit- 
tleton, and it seems probable that he remained 
on the same estate from marriage until death. 
He is styled in his account books and papers 
a "Weaver," a "Yeoman" and "Gentleman." 
He was constable, collector, selectman and 
treasurer at different times of the town of 
Littleton. He was a member and supporter 
of the church at Littleton. He purchased his 
farm from the town, January 13, 1717, a 
part being still in possession of his descend- 
ants. He died July 15, 1730, aged fifty-two 
years, two months and eight days. His wife 
Dorothy was appointed administratrix ; the 
estate inventoried one thousand pounds. Dor- 
othy Wood survived her husband twenty-two 
years and two days. She was left with a 
large family, but she cared for them and im- 
proved the estate left her by her husband. In 
the inventory of her estate is sixteen barrels 
of cider and a gold necklace appraised at 
fourteen pounds. She died July 17, 1752, 
and was buried in the Littleton churchyard 
by the side of her husband where grave- 
stones mark the resting place of five genera- 
tions of their family. Children of Jeremiah 
and Dorothy (Benett) Wood: Sarah. Eliza- 
beth, Joseph, see forward : Luce, Benett, John, 
Jeremiah, Sarah (2), Jonathan, Elephalet. 

(II) Joseph, eldest son of Jeremiah and 
Dorothy (Benett) Wood, was bom in Stow, 
Massachusetts, May 22, 1713. He married 
Grace Whettemore, of Concord, Massachu- 
setts, daughter of Benjamin and Esther 
(Brooks) Whettemore. and sister of Rev. 
Aaron Whettemore, for many years min- 
ister at Suncook, (now Pembrooke) New

Hampshire. He first settled at Littleton 
where his first child was born. In May, 1738, 
Joseph and his wife were dismissed from the 
church at Littleton to the church at Suncook, 
New Hampshire. The births of some of his 
children are recorded at Concord, Massachu- 
setts, and Cambridge records show transfers 
of land. His wife survived him and married 
(second) Ephraim Stow, of Concord, Janu- 
ary 14, 1745, which would place the date of

Massachusetts, for a time, from thence remov- 
ing to Rensselaerville, Albany county. New 
York, where he made wagons and was among 
the first to manufacture the celebrated "Jeth- 
ro Wood" cast iron plow. He carried on a 
successful manufacturing business, but his 
greatest success was in training and develop- 
ing in his machine shops, the founder of a 
great business, the product of which is adding 
to the world's comfort and wealth somewhere, 
every month and week in the year. Like the 
shot fired at Lexington, the click of the reaper

(V) Walter Abbott, second son of .Aaron

at Mason, Hillsboro county. New Hampshire, 
October 23, 18 15, died at Hoosick Falls,. 
Rensselaer county. New York, January 15,. 
1892. He was of a mechanical turn of mind 
and until he was twenty years of age re- 
mained with his father in his wagon and 
plow manufacturing works, where he became 
an expert machinist. In 1835 he went to- 
Hoosick Falls and worked at his trade in the 
machine shops of Parsons & Wilder, where- 
after a few years, having acquired a small 
capital, he established a like business of his 
own. He devoted his great mechanical skill 
and inventive genius to the improvement of 
the then crude and unsatisfactory farming 
machinery. The first result of his work was 
the introduction of the Manny Harvesting 
Machine with Wood's Improvements, and in 
the year 1852 over a hundred of these ma- 
chines were sold. In 1853 he had still fur- 
ther improved the machine, and the sales ran 
up to five hundred machines that year. He 
had now convinced the farmer of the great 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK \'ALLEYS 



value of his inventions, and half-satisfied him- 
self that they were practical and saleable. 
He now set about to increase his manufac- 
turing' facilities to meet the demand he had 
created. In 1859 he made and sold six thou- 
sand machines for harvesting and mowing; 
in 1869, 23,000; in 1879, 25,000; in 1884, 
48,000. In the meantime other companies had 
•entered the field and the great war of the 
rival companies was under full headway. Mr. 
Wood conducted his great and growing busi- 
ness until 1865, when he organized a stock 
corporation under the laws of the state of New 
York, and in 1866 began business as the 
Walter A. Wood Mowing & Reaping Machine 
Company, with a capital of $2,500,000. Mr. 
Wood was the first president of the company 
and the only one up to the date of his death. 
In i860 and again in 1890 the entire works 
were destroyed by fire, but in each case were 
■quickly rebuilt on a greatly enlarged scale. 
The Wood mowers and reapers were of su- 
perior design and construction, and up to the 
period of consolidation of several of the lead- 
ing makers, his sales surpassed in volume any 
single competitor. In field trials and com- 
petition events he easily was first and received 
from county, state, national and international 
■expositions, medals and certificates of first 
merit and far in excess of any rivals. He 
developed the foreign trade, established a 
London ofiice, and sent abroad fifty machines, 
the first like shipment ever made. They were 
•soon sold and a foreign trade assured. He 
met all comers in the foreign field as he had 
at home, and received the highest awards 
in England, 1861, at Leeds, London. At 
Paris, in 1876, he took leading rank, receiv- 
ing the gold medal of honor, also the cross 
•of the chevalier of the Legion of Honor. At 
the French international field trial, he took 
first prize against the world. At the Vienna 
International Exposition in 1873, after a sharp 
contest, he was awarded the highest prize, the 
■Grand Diploma of Honor, and knighted with 
the Cross of the Imperial Order of Francis 
Joseph, It was at this trial that he first 
brought into the field his celebrated harvester 
and binder. At the World's Paris Exposition 
of 1878, he won the highest prize and honor, 
the prize being "an object of art," the honor 
consisted of being promoted to "The Cross 
of an ofiicer of the Legion of Honor," His 
prizes numbered in 1885 over one thousand 
five hundred, many of them of great intrinsic 
value ; his home at Hoosick Falls being a ver- 
itable museum of rewards of merit. He con- 
tinued his successful career, and in perhaps 
the most bitter and costly war ever raged be- 
tween rival companies, upheld the honor of 



the Walter A. Wood Company, and fairly 
fought a winning battle. At last peace set- 
tled over the scene, and the efforts of the 
various companies turned to the legitimate 
ambition of furnishing the world with Amer- 
ican-made harvesting machinery. In this they 
have succeeded and brought untold wealth to 
their own country ; a white loaf to the count- 
less millions of our own and foreign lands, 
and everlasting honor and fortune to them- 
selves. In this great work the inventions 
of Mr. Wood have led, and he may justly be 
considered not only a benefactor to his own 
country, but to the entire agricultural world. 

During his absence in Europe attending 
the Paris Exposition in 1878 he was nomina- 
ted by the Republicans of the seventeenth 
New York congressional district, composed of 
Washington and Rensselaer counties, as their 
candidate for congress. On his return in Oc- 
tober, he acceded to the wishes of his friends 
and accepted the nomination. Although the 
district had elected a Democrat by five hun- 
dred majority the previous election, Mr. 
Wood was elected to succeed him, by a ma- 
jority of seven thousand. He was renomina- 
ted in 1880, and elected by seventeen thou- 
sand majority. He served creditably during 
his four years in congress but expressed no 
regrets when his term expired, politics being 
less congenial to him than his business. He 
was a warm and liberal friend of the church, 
belonging to the Episcopal denomination, and 
serving as senior warden of St. Mark's par- 
ish. Hoosick Falls, contributing largely to the 
building of the church edifice and to its sup- 
port. During the civil war he rendered val- 
uable service, and saw that no soldier's fam- 
ily was in need. At the immense works of 
his company at Hoosick Falls, a great many 
hundred men w-ere constantly employed and 
there existed between them and Mr, Wood 
the utmost harmony and good will. 

He married (first) in 1842, Betsey A., born 
at Hoosick Falls, New York, Jnne 19, 182 1, 
died May 24, 1867, daughter of Hon, Seth 
Parsons, of Hoosick Falls. Children : James 
S., died at the age of five years : Lyn P., born 
April 30, 1850, at P>rattleboro, Vermont, died 
April 22, 1877; married August 28, 1873,

cember 20, 1876, Mr. Wood married (sec- 
ond) September 2, 1868, Lizzie Warren,

(The Nicholls Line). 
. Mrs. Lizzie Warren (Nicholls) Wood was 
a descendant of that ancient English family 
of whom Burke says : "The origin of the an- 
cient family of Nicholls has been by antiquar- 
ians variously and largely treated upon. It 
is stated that at the time of Edward the Cori- 
queror, one, Nicholas de Albine, alias Ni- 
gell or Nicholl, came over from Normandy 
and was the common ancestor." The founder 
in America, from whom Mrs. Wood de- 
scends, was Francis Nicholls, born in Eng- 
land before 1600, son of Francis and Mar- 
garet (Bruce) Nicholls, and brother of Gov- 
ernor Richard Nicholls, who commanded the 
British fleet to whom the EHitch surrendered 
New Amsterdam. He received the surrender 
of the Dutch authorities, proposed the name 
New York for the new province, was gov- 
ernor of New York in 1664, and returned to 
England in 1667. Margaret Bruce was a 
daughter of Sir George Bruce, of Carnook, 
Scotland, and tenth in descent from King 
Robert Bruce, of Scotland. Francis Nicholls

TluTe was a town in Norfolk, 
11 AM )h:.\ luigland, called Heydon, which 

was a mile long and half as 
much broad. The jiresent name of Heydon or 
Haydon, as it is commonly called, signifies the 
High Down, or plain on the hill, which is 
agreeable to its situation. It is located in 
the Liberty of the Duchey of Lancaster ; the 
seat and demesne were called Heydon Hall 
or Manor — alias Stinton Hall and Manor. 
Heydon and Stinton Manors were subse- 
quently divided. The legal settlement of 
Heydon Manor makes the eldest son heir. 
The town of Hcydnn lies about fourteen miles 
a little west of nortii from Xorwich, the shire 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



1491 



town of Norfolk county. The lands there, 
according; to Domesday Book, were at the 
time of the Conqueror's survey under the lord- 
ship of one Whither, a Saxon, from whom the 
Conqueror took them and hestowed them upon 
the Earl of Warren — William de Warrena. 
The lieydons must have had their tenure from 
the \\'arrens as adherents or retainers of 
theirs. Very early we find them intermarried 
with the Warrens, also with the descendants of 
the Conqueror, with the Says, Alowbrays, 
Longvilles, Gurneys, Boleyns, etc. We find 
the name of Tliomas de Heydon mentioned as 
one of the prominent men of the twelfth 
century. 

(I) Thomas de Heydon, above referred to, 
was born in April, about 1185, died about 
1250. He lived in South Erpingham. and 
served as justice itinerant for Norfolk county 
in the reign of Henry HL 1221. The ofifice of 
justice (in Erye) was a commission held di- 
rectly from the king, having appellate jurisdic- 
tion of superior cases, to save going up to 
Westminster. One of the five provisions of 
Magna Charta signed by King John in 12 15 
was that such local justice be appomted in 
the county. This was not fulfilled, however, 
until after the death of John, during the 
minority of his son, Henry HL and under 
the regency of Robert De Burgh. Thomas de 
Heydon, therefore, was the first judge in Nor- 
folk appointed under ]\Iagna Charta. 

(II) William Heydon, son of Thomas de 
Heydon, was probably born about 1220, died 
about 1272. He was the first of the Devon 
line. 

(HI) John de Heydon, son of William 
Heydon, was a younger brother of the Wil- 
liam who was the third of the Norfolk line. 
John served as judge in Devon county in the 
first year of the reign of King Edward L 
1273, according to the records which we find 
in the Tower of London by Henry St. George 
Richmond. He was a younger branch of a 
knightly stock, so called, which flourished in 
the eastern parts of England, that is Norfolk. 
Whom he married is not known, but he had 
children, among them Robert. 

(T\') Robert Haydon, son of John de Hey- 
don. appears to have been the first to change 
the spelling of the first syllable by inserting 
"a" instead of the "e" which thenceforth dis- 
tinguishes the Devon line. He settled at 
Boughwood in the nineteenth year of Ed- 
ward I. The same year he deeded this estate 
to his son Henry and his wife Julian; the 
deed is attested by Thomas Frances, Ralph 
de Todwell and several others. His wife's 
name was Joan. 

(\') Henrv Havdon, .son of Robert and 



Joan Haydon, appears to have married his 
own cousin or near relation, as his wife Julian 
is stated to be daughter and heir to Heydon, 
of Ebford, which made said Henry possessor 
of several thousand dollars per annum. 

(\I) William (2) Haydon, son of Henry 
and Julian Haydon, inherited Boughwood. He 
married and among his children was Robert. 

(VH) Robert (2) Haydon, son of William 
(2) Haydon, succeeded him as owner of 
Boughwood. He married and among his chil- 
dren was John. 

(VHI) John (2) Haydon, son of Robert 
(2) Haydon, succeeded to the ownership of 
Boughwood. He married and among his chil- 
dren was Henry. 

(IX) Henry (2) Haydon, son of John (2) 
Haydon, was of Boughwood and Ebford, and 
seems to have been the first to come into full 
possession of both estates. This was in the 
twentieth year of the reign of Richard H, 
1397. Henry was succeeded by his son, John, 
of Boughwood and Ebford. who came into 
possession the eighth year of the reign of 
Henry IV, 1407. He married and had issue 
which seems not to have lived to inherit, so 
he was succeeded by his brother, William. 

(X) William (3) Haydon, son of Henry 

(2) Haydon, was of Lymston. He succeeded 
to the estates of Boughwood and Ebford. He 
married and among his children was Richard. 

(XI) Richard Haydon, fourth son of Wil- 
liam (3) Haydon. was living on the estate 
during the fifteenth year of the reign of Ed- 
ward IV, 1476. He married and had two 
sons, Richard and John, and one daughter, 
Jane. 

(XII) Richard (2) Haydon, .son of Rich- 
ard (i) Haydon. was of Boughwood and 
Ebford, and was living there in the thirteenth 
year of the reign of Henry VIII, 1522. He 
married Joan, daughter of Morice Trent, of 
Ottery, St. Mary. They had three sons. 
Thomas, John and George. 

(XIII) Thomas (2) Haydon, eldest son 
of Richard (2) Haydon, succeeded his father 
to the estates. He married Joan, daughter 
of Richard Weeks, of Honey Onirch, and 
among their children was Thomas. 

(XIV) Thomas (3) Haydon, son of 
Thomas (2) Haydon, succeeded his father to 
the estates. He married Christiania, daugh- 
ter and heir of Robert Tidersleigh. They 
had two sons. Robert and Thomas. 

(X\') Robert (3) Haydon, son of Thomas 

(3) Havdon, became heir to his great-uncle, 
John, and on the death of this relative he 
removed his family to Cadhay and resided 
there. He served as justice of the peace, and 
was living in 1620. He married Joan, eldest

HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



daughter of Sir Ainias Paulet, of George Hin- 
ton Somerset, and had three sons, Gideon, 
Amias and Drew, and one daughter, Margaret. 

(XV'I) Gideon Haydon, son of Robert (3) 
Haydon. owned the estates of Ebford and 
Cadhay, having succeeded his father, and is 
quoted as a very worthy, honest gentleman. 
It is said that the estates of Cadhay have never 
changed hands except by inheritance for seven 
hundred years. Sir Thomas Hare, the pres- 
ent owner, received them through the female 
line from the Williamses, as he himself be- 
lieves. Gideon Haydon married Margaret, 
daughter of John Davy, Esquire, of Greedy, 
and had seven sons and five daughters. Three 
of the sons were William, John and James. 
Several of the sons grew to manhood and 
were living in 1630. Haydons, descendants 
of this line, are still at Tiverton, and a num- 
ber having this spelling are in London. The 
late well-known B. R. Haydon, painter and 
native of Plymouth, belonged to this line. 

The above account was originally taken 
from the English records. In 1888 Mr. Jabez 
Haskell Hayden, of Windsor Locks, Connec- 
ticut, wrote a book on the Hayden genealo- 
gies, and therein, through the researches of 
Rev. William B. Hayden, of Portland, Maine, 
and I\Ir. Levi Hayden, of Roslindale, Massa- 
chusetts, show that there were three brothers, 
William. John and James Hayden, who came 
from England on the ship, "Alary & John," in 
1630, landing at Dorchester, Massachusetts. 
William is mentioned below. John remained 
a short time in Dorchester, later settled in 
Braintree, and his descendants are known as 
the "Braintree branch." James settled in 
Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1635, and died 
in 1675. He had a family of eight children. 
The Haydens of Saybrook, now Essex, Con- 
necticut, belong to this line. 

There were several other men who came 
over from England on the "Mary & John," 
among them being Roger Clapp. He was then 
a young man of twenty-one. The Rev. John 
Warham and Rev. John Maverick, both older 
men, came over at the same time and gave 
considerable advice to the young men of the 
party, as is shown from the records. All of 
these men came from three counties in Eng- 
land, namely : Devon, Dorset, Somersetshire. 

(XVII) William (4) Hayden, son of 
Gideon Ilaydon, came from England on the 
"Mary & John," 1630, landing at Dorchester, 
Massachusetts. After remaining there a short 
time, he removed to Windsor, Connecticut, 
where he resided until his death, and from 
him sprang the numerous descendants who are 
known as the "Windsor branch" of the Hay- 
den family. He served under Captain Mason 



in the famous Pequot war in 1637. He re- 
ceived land in the first distribution made in 
Hartford in 1639, and sold the same with 
dwelling house thereon February 9, 1642. 
Also about this time he purchased lands in 
Windsor, towards "Pine Meadow," and built 
a house upon it. In 1859 the site of this house 
was occupied by the residence of the late 
Henry Hayden, on the east side of the high- 
way at the junction of the two roads, south 
of Hayden Station, near Windsor, Connec- 
ticut. On that part of his farm lying west of 
the railroad station, he had a stone quarry 
which was worked as early as 1654. In 1669 
he deeded all his lands in Windsor, and build- 
ings thereon, to his son Daniel, who probably 
had not left the old homestead. His first 
wife died in 1655. He married (second) in 
Fairfield, Connecticut, Widow Wilcoxon. Wil- 
liam Hayden died at Killingworth, September 
27, 1669. He was the father of three chil- 
dren: Daniel, born September 2, 1640; Na- 
thaniel, February 2, 1642; Mary, June 6, 1648. 

(XVIII) Daniel, son of William (4) Hay- 
den, was born September 2, 1640, died March 
22, 1712-13. He married, March 17, 1664, 
Hannah Wilcoxon, who died April 19, 1722. 
They were the parents of eight children. 

(XIX) Samuel, fifth child of Daniel and 
Hannah (Wilcoxon) Hayden, was born Feb- 
ruary 28, 1677, died October 12, 1742. He 
married, January 24, 1703, Anna Holcomb, 
of Windsor, who died June 13, 1756, aged 
eighty-one years. They were tlie parents of 
six children. 

(XX) Samuel (2), second child of Samuel 
(i) and Anna (Holcomb) Hayden, was born 
October 7, 1707. He married, November 7, 
1737, Abigail Hall, of Somers, who bore him 
eight children. 

(XXI) Moses, third child of Samuel (2) 
and Abigail (Hall) Hayden, was born Sep- 
tember 23, 1742. When a young man he 
left Windsor, Connecticut, taking up his resi- 
dence at Conway, Franklin county, Massachu- 
setts. He married twice, names of wives un- 
known, and had one child by first wife, 
Moses. 

(XXII) Moses (2), son of Moses (i) Hay- 
den, was born in 1761, died at the home of 
his daughter, Asenath (Mrs. Daniel Bloss), 
in June. 1855, aged ninety-three years, and 
was buried in the cemetery at the stone church 
at Day Center, near where he had lived so 
many years. It appears that the young boy 
and his stepmother did not agree very well, 
and at the age of ten years he left home and 
thereafter depended upon his own resources. 
He located at what is now known as Holyoke, 
Massachusetts, where he resided for several

years, and about 1790 or 1792, having heard 
favorable reports about the section of the coun- 
try in and around the town of Day (called 
Concord), Saratoga county^ New York, re- 
moved thither, purchased a farm, built a 
house, and in the course of a year or two re- 
turned to Massachusetts and married Mary 
Boyd, a resident of Holyoke, whom he brought 
to his new home, where they lived together 
until her death, in 1828. Mr. Hayden married 
(second) Eunice Deming. The farm where 
Moses Hayden lived has been known as the 
"Hayden Farm" for more than one hundred 
years. Moses Hayden was of a religious turn 
of mind and affiliated with the Baptists. There 
was no Baptist church in that locality but the 
inhabitants of that denomination were in the 
habit of gathering at the school house for 
worship. Children of Moses and Mary 
(Boyd) Hayden: Polly (Mary), born Novem- 
ber 8, 1795, died May 5, 1863; John Boyd, 
February 21, 1798, died July, 1831 ; Solomon,

(XXHI) Solomon, son of Moses (2) and 
Mary ( Boyd) Hayden, was born January 30. 
1800. died March 20, 1879. He married, 
March 12, 1821, Annie Bloss, born March 3, 
1805, died May 23, 1886. They lived on a 
farm in the town of Day, New York, near 
his father's farm, until 1850, when they moved 
to the town of Edinburg, Saratoga county, 
New York, where they purchased a fann. re- 
siding thereon until the death of Mr. Hayden. 
They were both members of the Baptist So- 
ciety at Day, and upon their removal to Edin- 
burg they joined the Baptist church at North- 
ville, New York, and were regular attendants 
at the services during the remaining years of 
their lives. Children: Bethiah R., born Sep- 
tember 27, 1822, died July 26, 1863 ; she mar- 
ried the Rev. Timothy Day ; three children,

Hayden enlisted in November, 1861, at Sara- 
toga Springs, New York, and was assigned 
to Company D, Seventy-seventh Regiment, 
New York State Volunteer Infantry. He was 
trained at Saratoga Springs for some months 
and then his company was sent to the front. 
He was in several battles but escaped injury. 
In 1862, however, while the regiment was at 
White House Landing on the Pamunkey 
river, state of Virginia, he contracted typhoid 
fever. He was placed on a transport and 
sent with a large number of sick and 
wounded soldiers up the Potomac river to a 
hospital, but on the way up the river, during 
his delirium, he jumped overboard and was 
drowned. The body was recovered by his 
comrades and buried on the bank of' that 
river. 

(XXIV) John Carmi, son of Solomon and 
Annie (Bloss) Hayden, was born March 13, 
1834, died March 24, 1899, in Saratoga 
Springs, New York, at the home of his son. 
Adelbert C. Hayden. Notwithstanding the 
fact that his brother had lost his life in the 
war, John C. enlisted for service in the fall 
of 1864. He enlisted at Amsterdam, New 
York, and was assigned to Company I, Ninety- 
first Regiment, New York State \"olunteer 
Infantry. Early in the following year he was 
wounded in battle in Virginia and was sent 
to the hospital at Alexandria, and while there, 
recovering from his wounds, occurred the as- 
sassination of President Lincoln. Shortly 
after the close of the war he was mustered 
out of the service at Washington and re- 
turned to the town of Northampton, Fulton 
county. New York, where he had purchased 
a farm during the early years of the rebel- 
lion, removing thither from his farm near 
Edinburg, where he resided for two or three 
years after his marriage. He continued to 
live on the latter-named farm until after the 
death of his wife, in 1891. He married. No- 
vember 19, 1856, Martha Haight Ouinby, 
daughter of Aaron and Mary (Wilbur) 
Ouinby (see Quinby VIII), who bore him 
six children, namely : Adelbert Carmi. see for- 
ward ; Willis Adelma, born October 16, i860; 
Charles Aaron, December 20. 1863; Mary 
Anna, June 3, 1866; George Jay, September 
21, 1870; Eugene Elmer, December 13, 1873. 
The parents of John C. Hayden were mem- 
bers of the Baptist church, and the ancestry 
all seem to have been Baptists back through 
their history in this country. The parents of 
Mrs. Hayden were Quakers, members of the 
Quaker church at Quaker street. New York, 
and the ancestry for nearly three hundred 
years was known to have been Quakers. How- 
ever, the nearest church to their home on the

Sacandaga river at Osborne Bridge was a 
Methodist Episcopal church, which they both 
joined and continued to be members in good 
standing as long as they lived. 

(XXV) Adelbert Carmi, eldest child of John 
Carmi and Martha Haight (Quinby) Hay- 
den, was born April 26, 1858, at Northville. 
Fulton county. New York. He graduated at 
the State Normal School, Albany, in 1882. 
He served in the capacity of teacher in the 
schools of Conklingville and Crescent, Sara- 
toga county, and in Montgomery county, a 
position for which he was well qualiiied. 
Early in 1884 he accepted a position in the 
general postoffice department, Washington, 
D. C, and at the expiration of four years he 
resigned in order to accept a position at Sara- 
toga Springs, New York, where he has since 
resided. For the past six years he has served 
as vice-president of the Lincoln Spring Com- 
pany, and is actively identified with the inter- 
ests of the company. During his residence 
in Washington he was a member of the Cal- 
vary Baptist Church, a member of the board 
of trustees and a teacher in the Sunday school. 
After coming to Saratoga Springs he and his 
wife joined the First Baptist Church, in which 
he has taken an active part, serving as a 
member of the board of trustees for twelve 
years, superintendent of the Sunday school 
five years, and either an officer or a teacher 
in the school for twenty years. He has been 
an active worker in the Young Men's Chris- 
tian Association, been a member of the board 
of directors for almost fifteen years, being 
elected the first time under the presidency 
of G. F. Harvey, when they were located in 
the old Favorite Spring building; he served 
on the board while money was being raised 
and the site chosen for the present building. 
In igoi he was elected a member of the 
Board of Education of the village for a term 
of three years, re-elected in 1904, and was 
nominated for School Director of the town of 
Saratoga Springs in 1910 on the Republican 
ticket, but was defeated, owing to the Demo- 
cratic landslide. He was chairman of the 
teachers' committee for five years and a mem- 
ber of the teachers' committee for both his 
terms of office; he was also a member of the 
committee on schools for the entire six years ; 
these were important committees of the board. 
He was one of the special committee that 
recommended the adoption of the domestic 
science department in the local public schools, 
was a member of the special committee that 
recommended the addition of manual training 
to the local curriculum, and was chairman of 
the teachers' committee that engaged the first 
instructors in each of these departments. Mr. 



Hayden married, Alarch 9, 1887, Nellie Farr 
Lohnas, born in Schuylerville, New York, 
August 28, 1863, daughter of Deyoe and Hul- 
dali L. (Farr) Lohnas. Children: Grace 
Lohnas, born August 8, 1888, and Rita Mar- 
ion, born February 13, 1893. 

(The Quinby Line). 
The name of Quinby, spelled now Quinby, 
(^uimby and Quinbury, all of which are de- 
rived from the original name, Quinborough, 
corrupted to that of Quinbury, and finally 
Quinby, which is now the generally adopted 
style of writing the name. The name was 
derived from the name of a town in Norfolk 
county, England, called Quinborough. The 
family was originally of Norman-French ex- 
traction. The ancestors of the Quinby family 
in this country came from England. So far 
as known, only two men of that name came to 
America, viz., Robert and William Quinby. 
Robert Quinby settled in the town of Salis- 
bury, Massachusetts, in June, 1653. He mar- 
ried Elizabeth Osgood, who bore him four 
children: Lydia, William, John and Thomas. 
Two of the sons moved to the state of New 
Hampshire and are the progenitors of the 
Quinby family in that state and in Maine. 
Some families there spell the name Quimby. 

(I) William Quinby, the other early pro- 
genitor of the Quinby family in America, set- 
tled in Westchester, Westchester county. New 
York. In those early days the village of 
Westchester was only a small .scattered col- 
lection of houses and even up to 1700, one 
writer says, "the inhabitants lived up and 
down" and even in towns they lived on farms 
of ten acres. It is uncertain who William 
Quinby married. There is only one son named 
in the local history and family records. His 
name was John. 

(II) John, son of William Quinby, signed 
his name to one public document as "Quim- 
bie." He was a man of weight and influence 
in his community. In 1664, when a patent 
was given for the land he and his neighbors 
occupied, he with five others, received it in 
trust for all. In 1665 he was a representa- 
tive for his town in the assembly, summoned 
by Governor Nichols. He was a member 
of the organization corresponding to our 
present school board. He and his father 
were "dissenters," being members of the Con- 
gregational church, and when, at one time, 
they had no minister, John Quinby and three 
others were a])pointed to fill the vacancy. 

He married Deborah , who bore him 

four children: John, Charles, Josiah, Mary. 

(III) Josiah, son of John and Deborah 
Quinby, moved to .Maniaroneck, New \'ork.

where he purchased three hundred and twenty 
acres of land, comprising what was then called 
the "Great Neck." He is described later as 
being "late of Mamaroneck," so that it is 
probable that he returned to Westchester to 
live. He married Mary Mullinex (IMoly- 
neux), June 17, 1689. Children: Dorcas, Jo- 
siah, Jonathan. Samuel, Son. who died in 
.infancy: Ephraim, Aaron, Moses, Daniel, 
Phoebe, Isaiah, Martha. . It appears that Jo- 
siah Ouinby and his wife joined the "Society 
of Friends" while living in Mamaroneck. 
The Society met with much acceptance in this 
neighborhood, and Thomas Chalklcy mentions 
visiting there as early as 1725. In 1739 land 
was ]nirchased and a meeting house erected. 
The half-yearly meetings for Friends in all 
this section were held in this house. 

(I\') Moses, son of Josiah and Mary (Mul- 
linex ) Ouinby, married Jane, daughter of 
Francis and Elizabeth Pelham, in 1730. Chil- 
<lren : Elizabeth. Samuel. Frances. Mary, Jo- 
siah. Phoebe, Hannah. Isaiah, Martha, Son, 
who died in infancy : Susannah. 

(\') Samuel, son of Moses and Jane (Pel- 
ham ) Quinby, was born in Northcastle. W'est- 
chester county. New York. He married 
(first), March 17, 1756. Anna, born at Beth 
Page. Long Island, October 2, 1736, daugh- 
ter of Moses and Catherine Powel. He mar- 
ried (second) Phoebe L^nderhill, who bore 
him ten children, namely: Mary, Moses, Oba- 
diah. Josiah. Jane. Catherine. Clara, Anna, 

Eliza A., and . 

( \'I ) Obadiah son of Samuel and Phoebe 
(Underbill) Quinby, was born March 5, 1761, 
•died June 12, 1821. He married Freelove, 
born October 27, 1761. died December i, 
1829. daughter of Caleb Haight. Children : 
Anna, James, Mapelett. Hannah, Samuel, 
Aaron and Deborah. Obadiah Ouinby lived 
at Milan, Dutchess county. New York, where 
his children were reared. 

(\TI) Aaron, son of Obadiah and Free- 
love (Haight) Ouinby, was born August 2, 
1799. died May 15. 1875. He married, at 
Milan. New York, June 6, 1826. Mary, born 
November 29, 1806, died July 4, 1886, daugh- 
ter of Reuben and Susannah (Dean) Wilbur. 
Shortly after their marriage they moved to 
Duanesburg, Schenectady county. New York, 
where four of their children were born. 
.About 1839 they moved to Glens Falls, New 
^'ork. where they remained a few years. 
Their youngest child, Aaron Jay, was born 
there. Soon afterward they moved to the 
town of Stillwater, Saratoga county, New 
York, where they resided three years, on the 
"bank of the Hudson river, between Mechan- 
icsvillc and Stillwater. About 1850 they 



moved to the town of Edinburg, New York, 
where they resided on a farm until their 
death. Children : Sarah Ann, Susannah Free- 
love, Martha Haight, Edmond Carpenter, 
Aaron Jay. 

(\TII) Martha Haight, third child of 
Aaron and Mary (Wilbur) Quinby, married, 
November 19, 1856, John Canni Hayden (see 
Hayden XXIV), and they are the parents 
of Adelbert Carmi Hayden. 



This family settled in the Mo- 
SHULER hawk A'alley about the middle 

of the eighteenth century. 
They are originally of German nativity, the 
American ancestor being Lawrence Shuler. 
He became possessed of a tract of six hun- 
dred and forty acres, part of the two thousand 
acres conveyed to Edward and Philip Harri- 
.son, known as the Harrison patent. The 
original survey was made in 1737 by Christo- 
pher Yates. From the Harrisons one Dub<jis, 
a wealthy man of New York City, purchased 
six hundred and forty acres. This purchase 
was the immediate cause of the emigration 
to America of Lawrence Shuler, the founder. 
Dubois died, and his widow having need of 
the services of an agent to look after her 
northern lands was led, through recommen- 
dation, to write to Lawrence Shuler in Ger- 
many, offering him the position. This was 
in 1767, and he was then probably about 
twenty-one. He was born in Luxemburg, 
Germany, and had received a good education 
and possessed good business ability. He ac- 
cepted the ofTer and came to America and 
acted as Mrs. Dubois' agent in the manage- 
ment of her Florida lands. Their business 
acquaintance resulted in their marriage, and 
thus the estate passed into the Shuler name, 
where it remained for over one hundred and 
twenty-five years. The estate is situated one 
and a half miles east of Minaville, in one of 
the best and most beautiful parts of the town. 
No owner of the Shuler name has ever died 
upon the estate, it so happening tiiat they 
were absent from home when their final hour 
came. Neither Lawrence Shuler nor his wife 
died there. Their children were: John, see 
forward; Jacob, Solomon, Lawrence (2), 
Elizabeth. Lawrence (i) Shuler married 
(second) Magdalena Servoss, who bore him 
Abraham and Sarah, and i)ossibly others. 
Abraham died an old man, unmarried; Sarah 
married Cornelius Van Derveer, afterward 
accidentally killed, leaving a daughter Helena. 
The children of the first wife, all married 
and reared families. The estate was divided 
into smaller farms and each, at times, owned 
portions.

The English Monsons belong- 
MUNSON ing to the peerage have a rec- 
ognized history extending 
through five centuries. According to 
"Burke's Peerage," John Monson was liv- 
ing in 1378, and denominated of East Market 
Rasen, county of Lincoln, from whom lineally 
sprang William Monson, Esq., who died in 
1558. It is the opinion of eminent members 
of the family that their common ancestor was 
a Dane. The name is common in Denmark, 
and that portion of England where the family 
were dwelling in the fourteenth century had 
been overrun by the Danes. 

(I) Thomas Munson, the American ances- 
tor, was among those exiles w-ho left Eng- 
land for conscience sake, brave and spirited 
men who were loyal to their God and their 
convictions. He was born in England about 
1612, died May 7, 1685. It is not known how 
or when he came to -America. He is first 
found of record in Hartford, Connecticut, 
in 1637, where he performed service in the 
Pequot war. He received a grant of one 
hundred acres, which was confirmed by the 
general court. May 13, 1637, no doubt in rec- 
ognition of his services in that war. In 1639 
he became one of the pioneer settlers of New- 
Haven, Connecticut, where he acquired a house 
lot in February, 1640. He was one of the 
sixty-three signers of the "Agreement." He 
took the oath of fidelity July i, 1644, and 
was appointed sergeant of the "trayned iDand," 
a title he bore for nineteen years. May 19, 
1656, he was chosen one of seven townsmen 
(selectmen). In 1661 he was appointed "En- 
signe," and was assigned "seat No. 2 of the 
shorte seats in the meeting house." April 28, 
1663, "Ensigne Thomas Munson and John 
Moss were chosen deputies for the jurisdiction 
General Courte for the yeare ensueinge." In 
1665, after the union of New Haven Colony 
with Connecticut Colony, John Winthrop, 
governor, he was chosen deputy to the general 
assembly. July 6, 1665, he was confirmed by 



the general assembly lieutenant "of ye traine 
band at New Haven." In 1666 he was again 
chosen deputy, and in 1668 assigned a new 
seat in the meeting house; he was now one 
of the thirteen persons seated "in the first 
seat" in the gallery. April 29, 1668, he was 
elected one of seven townsmen (selectmen), 
and in 1669 again chosen deputy; in fact, this 
office was bestowed upon him, as well as that 
of selectman, almost continuously until his 
death in 1685. At a session of the general 
court, held at Hartford, August 7, 1673, the 
following "special order" was passed: 
"Whereas there is now at present a great 
appearance of danger towards the Colony 
by the approach of the Dutch, for our own 
safety and defence till the general court in 
October next, it is now ordered by this court 
that the committee hereafter named, viz : The 
Governor, Deputy-Governor, and assistants 
(five others), and Lieutenant Thomas Mun- 
son, are hereby empowered to act as the- 
Grand Committee of this Colony in establish- 
ing and commissioning of military officers, in 
pressing men, houses, ships, barques, or other 
vessels, arms, ammunition, provision, car- 
riages, or whatever they judge needful for our 
defense, and to manage, order and dispose 
of the militia of the colony in the best way 
and manner for our defense and safety." This 
was the first appointment of a grand commit- 
tee, or as afterwards termed "council of war." 
During King Philip's war he was in command 
of troops in and around Saj-brook. and May 
13, 1676, was appointed captain of New Ha- 
ven county soldiers, and in 1682 was a com- 
missioner to treat with the Indians. Sep- 
tember 29, 1684, he was. for the last time, 
elected deputy to the general court, and May 
7. 1685, he closed an exceeding busy and use- 
ful life. He was continuously in the ser- 
vice of town, colony and church until the 

last. He married Joanna , born about 

1610, died December 13, 1678. 

(II) Samuel, only son of Thomas and Jo- 
anna Munson, was baptized in New Haven, 
Connecticut, First Church. -August 7. 1643, 
died 1693. He was made a freeman of New 
Haven, May 9, 1667, and assigned in the 
meeting house a seat with fourteen others in 
the "second scat in the gallery." In 1670 
he was one of the thirty-nine men who signed 
the agreement to become "Planters" and settle 
in the wilderness north of New Haven, now 
W'allingford, Connecticut. Here he was as- 
signed a house lot on the "Long Highway" 
(Main street), and a farm of eight acres. 
He was chosen selectman in .April. 1672, and 
June 7 "Samuel Munson shall be allowed forty 
shillings for maintaining and beating the 



1498 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



Drum in good order for the yeare ensuing." 
In 1674 lie was again chosen one of five 
"townsmen." King Philip's war now being 
waged, he was appointed "Ensigne of Walling- 
ford Traine Band." Under date of Septem- 
ber 10. 1677, it was "voted that Ensign Mun- 
son shall have fourty shillings allowed him 
for meeting in his house this yeare." He 
was chosen "lister" in 1678, and one of the 
two sealers of leather. November 27, 1678. 
■ occurs the first mention of schools in the town 
record. December 24 it was voted to allow 
ten pounds for a schoolmaster and three pence 
per week for each scholar attending. April 
12, 1679, Samuel Munson was chosen to serve 
as the first schoolmaster. He was successively 
auditor, selectman, treasurer, and recorder of 
the town. In 1682 he apparently returned to 
New Haven to reside, perhaps to make a 
home for his widowed father, perhaps to be- 
come master of Hopkins grammar school. 
The earliest record book of the Hopkins gram- 
mar school begins with 1684, under date of 
January 4, "agreed that Ensign Munson go 
on with the grammar school at New Haven 
to make up his year current, and his allow- 
ance to be £40 per annum as formerly, also 
that trial be made of the sufficiency of the 
said Ensign Munson and if he be sufficient 
to instruct or fit hopeful youth for the College 
that he have £50 for the ensuing vear." Three 
months later he "laid down his charge," and 
was succeeded by a graduate of Harvard 
College. It is uncertain whether he was rector 
of the school one, two or three years. He was 
one of the sealers of leather in New Haven, 
1683-85-86, and in 1692, lister, and constable. 
This useful life ended the following year. He 
married, October 26, 1665, Martha, daughter 
of William Bradley. 

(Ill) Thomas, second son of Samuel and 
Martha (Bradley) Munson, was born March 
12, 1 67 1, died in Cheshire, Connecticut, Sep- 
tember 28, 1746. He was a husbandman, and 
resided in New Haven. He was favored in 
the distribution of his grandfather's estate, 
and dealt largely in real estate during his life. 
He held several of the town offices, and in 
1 7 16 was a contributor to the amount of land 
■donated to secure Yale College for New 
Haven. He thus assisted in founding that 
celebrated university which, a little later, was 
removed to New Haven from Saybrook. Like 
all the family preceding him, he was a mem- 
Tjer of the Congregational First Church, 
which he joined in New Haven, September 
25. 1735- His wife had been a communicant 
■of the First Qiurch since 1698. He mar- 
ried, September 15, 1694, Mary Wilcox, who 
■died November 28, 1755. 



(IV) Obadiah, fourth child of Thomas and 
Mary (Wilcox) Munson, was born in New 
Haven, April 3, 1703, died in Wallingford, 
April 29, 1773. He was a mill owner and 
farmer, and during his life he dealt exten- 
sively in real estate, residing in New Haven, 
Cheshire and North Haven (Wallingford). 
He is buried in the North Haven cemetery. 
He married, March 27, 1729, Hannah Booth. 

(\') Obadiah (2), eldest son of Obadiah 
(i) and Hannah (Booth) Munson, was born 
in New Haven, August 27, 1731, died May 26, 
1805. He was a mill owner and farmer of 
Connecticut, his home, until 1771, when he 
removed to the Wyoming valley, Pennsyl- 
vania, where he remained until 1778, when 
he returned to Connecticut (Plymouth), dying 
at Harwmton, that state. His residence in 
P.ennsylvania was in Luzerne county, near 
Pittston. "He purchased a tract of land on 
the eastern bank of the Susquehanna, built his 
log cabin and hoped to make for himself and 
family a permanent home." When the valley 
seemed in danger from Indians and British 
he left his family and went back to Connecti- 
cut to prepare a home for them. His wife 
died at the time of the massacre, and at least 
four of his sons were in the revolutionary 
army. During his absence the massacre at 
Wyoming occurred, and he never returned 
to the valley. He was a member of the First 
Church of Christ, of Harwinton, Connecticut. 
He was a man of remarkable constitution, 
broad-shouldered, and very strong. He could 
lift a barrel of cider and put it over the rave 
of a cart. He was a good business man and 
led an active, useful life. He married Rachel 
Tyler. 

(\T) Stephen, fourth child of Obadiah (2) 
and Rachel (Tyler) Munson, was born in 
Wallingford (now Cheshire), Connecticut, 
February 10, 1759, died July 9, 1824. He was 
a saddler and a farmer. At the time of the 
Wyoming massacre he was with the army 
of Washington at Morristown, New Jersey, 
in Captain Durkee's company. He was also 
a member of one of the "Valley Independent 
Companies" that saw much hard service. He 
is desvibed on the roster of Captain Durkee's 
company as five feet five inches tall, aged 
eighteen. He was a man of means and genial 
nature. He resided in various towns of Con- 
necticut, and in Westfield and Huntington, 
Massachusetts. He married, March 13, 1783, 
Elizabeth, daughter of William Andrus. 

(VII) Daniel, eldest child of Stephen and 
Elizabeth (.'\ndrus) Munson, was born Janu- 
ary 22, 1786, died at Huntington, October 7, 
1839. His early schooling was in Southington 
and at Wolcolt. At fourteen the family re-

moved to Westfield, Massachusetts, where he 
attended academy two winters. He "farmed 
it" during summers, and after leaving the 
academy taught a winter scliool at Blanford, 
the next winter at Chesterfield, the next at 
■Goth's Hill, and then at Falley's Roads. A 
sedentary life did not agree with him, and 
he gave up the idea of going to college, for 
which he had been preparing. He was a 
farn.er all his days. He served as constable 
in Norwich and three terms as selectman. He 
is remembered as a person of elevated char- 
acter and courtliness of manner. He was a 
Whig and Congregationalist. He married, 
January 18, 1810, Jerusha. born May i, 1786, 
died March 10, 1852. daughter of Ebenezer 
Fowler, of Westfield, Massachusetts. 

(MH) Garry, eldest child of Daniel and 
Jerusha (Fowler) JMunson, was born Decem- 
ber 29, 1810, died June 5, 1882. After leav- 
ing the district school he attended Westfield 
(Massachusetts) Academy five terms and then 
■engaged in teaching. In April, 1829, at the 
age of eighteen, he opened a store on Chester 
Hill in coimection with his father, and this 
business continued eight years. On the day 
he was twenty-one he began making twist but- 
tons, and the year following, the production 
of lasting buttons. In 1835 he was employ- 
ing over two hundred persons. After a few 
years the introduction of machine-made but- 
tons drove him out of the business. During 
the financial panic of 1837 he lost two-thirds 
of his property, and he removed to Spring- 
field, where for two and a half years he was 
a partner with Galen Ames in the dry goods 
business. In 1840 he removed to Huntington, 
where he took possession of the farms at Nor- 
wich Bridge, which had been owned by his 
father and' grandfather since 1807. He also 
opened a store which he operated for five 
years. He acquired a half interest in a lumber 
mill. In 1848 he built a store in the village, 
where he carried on business three and a 
half years until fire destroyed the building. 
For many years he was an extensive wool 
buyer. In 1870-71 he was a member of De- 
laney & Munson, with paper mills at Union- 
ville. Connecticut. In 1872 he became a part- 
ner in the Massasoit Knitting Mills at Co- 
hoes, New York. He devoted much of his 
time during his later years to the settleir.ent 
of estates. He was trial justice in the Hunt- 
ington district, and at the time of his death 
commissioner of insolvency, and president of 
the Cemetery Association and of Huntington 
Hall Association. Politically, he was a Whig 
and later a Republican. At the age of thirty- 
four he was electerl to the legislature, and 
was repeatedly elected selectman, h'or twenty- 



five or thirty years he was almost continu- 
ously moderator of the town meetings. He 
was a member of the Congregational church 
and one of the founders of the Second Congre- 
gational church in Huntington. When it was 
destroyed by fire he gave more than any other 
toward replacing it. For twenty-five' years 
he served as deacon. He was diligent in at- 
tendance upon public worship and in maintain- 
ing family worship. He keenly enjoyed family 
reunions, and for years he and three brothers 
had annual gatherings in their homes succes- 
sively. After his children began to form 
homes of their own he established the cus- 
tom of having them gather at the old home- 
stead every alternate Thanksgiving. He had 
rare sagacity, rare judgment, rare power to 
execute, and a rare wealth of practical in- 
formation. The judicial quality of his mind 
was noteworthy, and his proper function, had 
he been educated for it, was upon the bench. 
He was devoted to his family and gave his 
sons every encouragement, both in advice and 
practical help. He married, November 6, 
1833, Harriet Lyman, born October 10, 1810, 
died August 18, i860, daughter of Colonel 
and Deacon Samuel Lyman, of Chester, Mas- 
sachusetts. She bore him seven children. 

(IX) Samuel Lyman, fifth child of Dea- 
con Garry and Harriet (Lyman) Munson, 
was born in Norwich, now Iluntington, Mas- 
sachusetts, June 14, 1844. His early education 
was acquired in the common school, and at the 
age of twelve he entered Williston Seminary, 
where he studied three years. He then en- 
tered a Boston dry goods store, where he re- 
mained two years. Impaired health brought 
him back to the farm, where a year of out- 
door work restored him to vigor. After a 
course at the Bryant & Stratton Commercial 
School at Albany, New York, he became a 
traveling salesman for Wickes & Strong. 
Four years he remained with them, and then 
in 1867, in company with two other young 
men, established a factory for the manufacture 
of linen collars. Two years later he assumed 
sole control, steadily increasing his business 
until 1884, when he purchased the Hudson 
.\venue Methodist Church and converted it 
into a factory where he has since been engaged 
in the manufacture of linen and lace goods, 
employing about one thousand hands. In 
1889 he built another factory at Cobleskill, 
New York, for the exclusive manufacture of 
shirts. As an organizer to plan and con- 
duct a business Mr. Munson has few equals; 
from a very small begimiing he has built up 
a business of large dimensions. While he has 
always given the closest attention to his busi- 
ness, other interests have attracted him. He

lection and preservation of family history and

Weekapaug, Rhode Island ; governor of the 
Albany Qiapter of the Society of Founders

reason of long connection with the order, mem- 
bership in the Masonic Veterans' Associa- 
tion, of Albany, of which he became president. 
He is an extensive traveler, and frequently 
delivers lectures on travel and other subjects. 
His large collection of books afford him one 
of his principal recreations, and with golf, 
his favorite pastime, fill the hours of leisure. 
In politics he is a Republican, that having 
been, almost without an exception, the family 
politics ever since the formation of the party. 
He was a presidential elector in igoi. He 
resides in Albany, where, in a beautiful home, 
his large library of well-selected books, in- 
dicates his breadth of mind, and wide range 
of thought.

Gentleman, who bore arms and brought over 
considerable money to invest for his friends 
in Bitterswcll, Lancastershire, England. In 
1647 he became one of the ten original settlers 
of Sandwich. In 1647-48 we find him one of

The surname Parker is derived 
PARKER from the Latin "parcarius," 

parkkeeper. or shepherd. 
Danes. Saxons and Normans all seem to have 
had the name at an early date. Parcum and 
de Parco are found in Domesday Book. As 
early as 900-925. in the reign of Edward I, 
a GeofTrey Parker is mentioned even before 
the common use of surnames in England. 
The family bore arms, that of the Browns- 
holme family of Parker, the pedigree of which 
is traced to William le Parker, of Wiztwistle. 
Lancashire, before 1400 is: Vert, a chevron 
between three stags' heads cabossed or ; crest : 
a leopard head afifrontee erased or, ducally 
gorged gules ; motto : Sepre Ande ( dare to be 
just). This coat-of-arms descended through 
the Park Hall and Staffordshire lines, and is 
that used by Sir Thomas Parker. Earl of 
Macclesfield. England. A Parker branch that 
settled in Dutchess county. New York, de- 
scended from James Parker, a taxpayer in 
Woburn. Massachusetts, in 1645. * 

(L) John Parker was born in 1799. died 
November 30. 1848, aged forty-eight years, 
ten months and sixteen days. He had a 
brother, Samuel, who had children : Philip and 
Philo, twins, who were of Shelbyville. Illi- 



nois. John Parker settled at an early date 
in Saratoga county. New York, where he 
engaged in farming and lumbering. He mar- 
ried Nancy McQueen, who died December 26, 
1888, aged eighty-four years, four months, six 
days, daughter of Robert and Betsey Mc- 
Queen. Robert McQueen died July 6, 1834, 
aged seventy-five years; Betsey McQueen 
died November 14. 1840, aged seventy-seven 
years. 

(II) Robert, son of John and Nancy (Mc- 
Queen) Parker, was born in the town of 
Galway, Saratoga county, New York. He 
engaged there in the lumber business and 
operated a farm. In 1888 he removed to 
Michigan, where he yet resides (1910). He 
married Margaret Timeson, who died in i860. 
Their only child was John Nicholas, see for- 
ward. 

(III) John Nicholas, only son of Robert 
and Margaret (Timeson) Parker, was born 
in the town of Providence, Saratoga county. 
New York, September 20. 1854, died in Sche- 
nectady, New York, February 23, 1907. His 
mother died when he was a lad of six years,, 
and his early training devolved upon an aunt,, 
who cared for him until he was ready to go 
out into the world and make his own way. 
This time came all too soon. He attended 
the winter schools, and in summer worked on* 
a farm, receiving, at first, six dollars a month, 
working at this wage for two years, when he 
was raised to eight dollars. After two years 
more on the farm he yielded to the charm the 
Erie canal had for the farmer boy, and se- 
cured a job as water boy, where he earned 
a good round dollar every day. His uncle, 
Hiram Parker, was proprietor of a hotel at 
Acqueduct. and for eleven years John N. lived 
with him. He was treasuring his dollars, and 
after eleven years had sufficient capital to en- 
gage in business on his own account. For the 
next seven years he conducted the hotel at 
Rexford Flats, at the same time operating in 
all kinds of farm produce, under the firm- 
name of John N. Parker & Company. He- 
shipped large quantities of hay, grain and 
kindred products, and conducted a profitable 
business, which he continued until his death. 
After disposing of his Rexford Flats' prop- 
erty he operated the hotel at .Acqueduct for 
four years. He built a fine residence at that 
place, which was his home ever after. He 
sold his hotel interest, and henceforth de- 
voted himself to his produce business, the 
public service in the state of New York, and 
to business interests in the city of Schenec- 
tady. He was treasurer of the Schenectady 
Paving and Contracting Company, a concern 
that carried on the largest business of the- 



IS04 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



kind in northern New York. He also had an 
interest in the Niskayiina Ice Company, and 
was a director of the Schenectady Trust Com- 
pany. He continued his successful business 
career up to the time of his death. In public 
life Mr. Parker was well known and promi- 
nent. He was a local leader in the Republi- 
can party, and influential in state party coun- 
cils. He was honored and respected as a 
leader in Schenectady county, and always 
proved a formidable opponent at the polls. 
He held many public offices in the county; 
was road commissioner; for two terms repre- 
sented his town on the board of supervisors, 
T)eing elected without opposition. In 1894 
he was appointed by Governor Levi P. Morton 
division superintendent of the eastern division 
of the Erie canal, going back in authority to 
the scene of his boyhood labor, and held this 
position twelve years. He was a capable of- 
ficial, and served his state well. At the time 
■of his death he was assistant superintendent of 
public works of the state of New York. He 
was a familiar figure at party state conven- 
tions, and frequently was a delegate to Re- 
publican national conventions. His public life 
was clean, and he always made it his boast 
that he never had a dollar which he did not 
■earn. He spent a life of active effort, and 
earned a deserved success. He was prominent 
in the Masonic order, belonging to St. George 
Lodge, Chapter and Commandery. and was a 
noble of Oriental Temple, Order of the Mystic 
Shrine. He was a charter member of 
Schaughmaugh-ta-da Tribe of Red Men, and 
■of the Benevolent and Protective Order of 
Elks. He married, October 14, 188 1, Kathe- 
rine, daughter of John Blair, of Schenectady, 
and Julia Blair, of St. Johnsville, New York, 
who survives her husband. Children: i. John 
Tiobert, see forward. 2. Ethel B., bom July 
21, 1884; married George G. Schieffelin ; 
•child: Richard G. 3. James C, July 20, 1887; 
educated at Phillips Exeter Academy ; now a 
real estate dealer of Schenectady ; married 
■Grace Gilbert. 

• (IV) John Robert, eldest son of John 
Nicholas and Katherine (Blair) Parker, was 
Ijorn at Rexford Flats, Saratoga county, New 
York, October 14, 1882. He was educated in 
the public school, Schenectady high school, 
Union Classical Institute, Albany Business 
College, Mt. Beacon Military Academy, Fish- 
kill, New York, and was graduated LL.B. 
from Cornell University, class of 1907. He 
was admitted to the Kentucky bar, and in 
1907 to the New York bar, and at once began 
the practice of his jirofession in Schenectady, 
as a partner of the law firm of Wemple & 
Parker. In 1909 this partnership was dis- 



solved, and he is now conducting a general law 
practice alone. He has always taken an active 
part in politics, following in the footsteps of 
his father. In 1909 he was the Republican 
candidate for the state legislature from Sche- 
nectady, being beaten by the slender majority 
of two hundred and eighty-seven votes. He 
is a member of the Episcopal church ; Sigma 
Chi (Cornell) ; Phi Delta Phi, a legal fra- 
ternity; Phi Psi, a preparatory school fra- 
ternity; Schenectady County Bar Association; 
Schenectady Board of Trade; Mohawk Club; 
Mohawk Golf Club, and the Press, Republican 
and Boat clubs of Schenectady. He married, 
July 3, 1907, at Newcastle, Kentucky, Fannie 
Symes, born February 21, 1883, daughter of 
]\iajor Sanford. of an old Kentucky family, 
and Fannie (Smith) Sanford, and grand- 
daughter of Charles Sanford. Mr. and Mrs. 
Parker have a son, John Robert (2), born 
September 12, 1908. 



From the time of the Dutch 
HOTALING ancestor, Mathys Hooghtee- 

ling, this name had caused 
deepest woe to those bearing it. on account of 
the many ingenious ways it can be spelled. 
Houghteling is one of the most common forms, 
but the tendency now seems to be toward 
the simpler form, Hotaling. Mathys Hoogh- 
teeling was born 1644 (it is supposed in Hol- 
land), died 1706. He is the first of his name 
in the Hudson Valley. In 1697 a patent of 
land was granted him in Rensselaerwyck in 
the present town of Coxsackie. He married 
Maria Hendrickse and had three sons and 
two daughters. 

(II) Coenradt, son of Mathys and Maria 
(Hendrickse) Hotaling (Hooghteeling), was 
born about 1667. He married, 1688, Tryntja 
Willemse Van Slyck, and had eleven chil- 
dren. 

(III) Willeni, second child of Coenradt and 
Tryntja W. (Van Slyck) Hotaling, was bap- 
tized January 17, 1692. He was a farmer and 
a freeholder of the town of Bethlehem, Al- 
bany county, in 1742. He married Lena Uzile, 
November 9, 1716, and had nine children. 

(IV) Jonathan, son of Willem and Lena 
(Uzile) Hotaling, was baptized September 
12, 1736. He married Jannetie Slingerland, 
November 2, 1754. He cultivated a farm in 
New -Scotland ancl Bethlehem, and died, leav- 
ing sons, Coenrad, Johannes and Wouter. His 
eldest child and only daughter was Neeltje, 
baptized September 28, 1755. 

(V) Coenrad, son of Jonathan and Jannetie 
(.Slingerland) Hotaling, was ba]itized Novem- 
ber I, 1761, died in the town of Berne in 1831. 
He owned a large tract of land wiiich, at his 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK \'ALLEYS 



1505 



death, was divided among his two sons, Aaron 
and Jonathan. Coenrad was an active mem- 
ber of the Methodist Episcopal church, and 
was a class leader. He was a Democrat and 
a man of intkience in his town. He was twice 
married. Children: Aaron, of whom further; 
Jonathan, died in Montezuma, New York, in 
1903, leaving a son, Gabriel; Solomon, settled 
in the west, where he married, and had thir- 
teen children. 

(\'I) Aaron, son of Coenrad and Jaiietta 
(l')Ogardus) Hotaling, was born in the town 
of New Scotland, Albany county. New York, 
in 1797, died in the city of Albany in 1866. 
At the division of his father's property it 
was supposed that he got the less valuable 
half, but he later discovered upon it quarries 
of bluestone that made him a very rich man. 
Albany sidewalks are paved almost exclusively 
with flagstones taken from these quarries, and 
innumerable carloads have been shipped to dis- 
tant points. In 1855 he retired from the ac- 
tive operation of his quarries and settled in 
a comfortable home in Albany, where he died 
«leven years later. The quarries are located 
near Reedville, in the town of Berne, and are 
yet a source of supply for flagging purposes. 
He was originally a member of the INIetho- 
dist Episcopal church, but later became con- 
nected with the First Baptist Church in Al- 
bany. He was a man of religious nature, and 
lived a most exemplary life. Iij politics he 
-was a Democrat. He married, in 1826, in 
Berne, Mary (Polly) Rogers, born in Al- 
bany county about 1800, died in Albany shortly 
after the removal to th^ city in 1855. She 

was a daughter of Captain Thomas and 

(Wheat) Rogers. Captain Thomas Rogers 
was a soldier of the revolution. He was 
•extensively engaged in lumbering and gained 
bis title of captain from his river operations. 
He owned large tracts of timber in Washing- 
ton county, and drove his logs, when prac- 
ticable, down the Hudson to mills below. He 
was a well-known character, and with Dea- 
con Philips, established the First Baptist 
■church in Albany county, and was officially 
connected with it during his lifetime. He 
was one of the leading business men of his 
day. His two sons, Dr. Samuel and Dr. 
Hiram Rogers, went west, settled in Quincy, 
Illinois, wiiere they helped to organize and 
"build the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Rail- 
road. They became well known as prosperous 
business, rather than as professional men. His 
son, Thomas Rogers, was a farmer of New 
Scotland, and still another, Peniel, also set- 
tled in Quincy, Illinois, married, and left two 
sons, George, a prominent attorney of Spring- 
field, Illinois, and Hiram, leading druggist 



of Quincy. Captain Thomas Rogers died in 
Berne in 1849, in the ninety-first year of his 
age. Children of Aaron and Mary Hotaling: 
Hiram, of whom further; Oscar, born in 
Reedville, New York, 1830, died in New Scot- 
land in 1905; married Leah Loucks and left 
Harry, now a resident of New Scotland, and a 
daughter, Mariette Mickle; William Chaun- 
cey, died in Albany, 1904; married Eleanor, 
daughter of John Moore, of Albany ; they 
have no living issue; LoXiisa, married William 
H. Conger. 

(VH) Hiram, eldest son of Aaron and 
Mary (Rogers) Hotaling, was born in the 
town of Berne, Albany county. New York, 
March 16, 1828. He was educated in the 
public schools, and in early life was a farmer. 
He was especially interested in fine stock 
breeding, and owned some of the first Dur- 
ham short-horned cattle. In 1858, after the 
removal of the family to Albany, he engaged 
in the ice business in that city, which he 
prosecuted with such vigor that in a few years 
he had earned the title of "Ice King" of the 
Hudson river. During one year he had a 
complete monopoly of the city ice trade, sup- 
plying, in addition to the family trade, the 
large beef companies, hotels and restaurants. 
He became very prosperous and extended his 
operations to more distant points, not, how- 
ever, with satisfactory results. He was a most 
capable man of business and a hard worker, 
richly deserving the success he won. He affili- 
ated with the Democratic party until 1870, 
when he transferred his allegiance to the Re- 
publican. He now lives in quiet retirement 
in Albany, spending his summers in his home 
in the suburbs. He is a member of the First 
Baptist Church of Albany and a man of high 
character. He married, in Berne. Louisa 
Gardiner, died in Albany in 1892. She was, in 
later life, a member of the Baptist church, 
of deeply religious nature and truly womanly 
character. She was a daughter of Hon. James 
D. Gardiner, of the (Gardiner's Island, New 
York, family. Gardiner's Island lies three 
miles east of the most easterly point of Long 
Island, and is seven miles in greatest length 
and one mile in greatest width. The area 
is about three thousand, three hundred acres, 
some in barren hills, ponds and beaches. The 
island was first granted to Leon Gardiner, 
born in England about 1399. died in East 
Hampton, Long Island, 1663. For two hun- 
dred and fifty years the island has been kept 
in the family name and in possession of the 
descendants of the first owner, eight proprie- 
tors having lived in the mansion house. Leon 
Gardiner was a man of great prominence in 
earlv colonial atifairs, and had great influence 



i5o6 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



with both the colonial officials and with their 
foes, the Indians. He married May Wilem- 
son, born in Holland. The line of descent 
is through David Gardiner, son of Leon, and

county families, Colonel James Gardiner, an 
uncle' of James D. Gardiner, served in the 
revolutionary war, where he held the commis- 
sion of colonel, and a part of his equipment

at Albany, resigning on account of failing 
health. He then engaged in Albany as a 
wholesale dealer in coal until his sudden death. 
In early life he prepared for the profession 
of law and was admitted to the New York 
state bar in 1878. He was a pleasing and 
forcible public speaker and often in demand.

York state. 



The Pittz family of Albany, here- 
PITTZ in considered, of whom Dr. John 
Pittz is the head, descend from 
German ancestry. The grandfather of Dr. 
Pittz lived to be over ninety years of age. 
as did his father, John (i), who was born 
in Battledorf, Germany, in a Rhine province, 
in 1782. John Pittz, Sr., was a proficient 
musician, and served in the army of Napoleon 
the Great, followed that great commander in 
his disastrous invasion of Russia, and was one 
of the few who saw the burning of Moscow 
and lived to return to their homes. He was 
pensioned for his military service and lived 
many years to tell of that great campaign. 



He was a man much loved in his village and 
sought after for his musical attainments and 
general good qualities. He died in 1871, in 
his native province. He married Weyler 
Dreis, born in the same house in which she 
was married. Her father was also a soldier of 
the Napoleonic wars, and held an office under 
the government. Children : Nicholas, born 
July 17, 1 84 1, yet a resident of the German; 
town of his birth; he served in the German 
army; two of his sons are soldiers in the 
German army, and served in the Franco-Prus- 
sian war of 1870-71. Jacob, for many years 
a police guard under the local government, 
died in 1889, leaving a daughter Catherine. 

The eldest child. Marguerite, married 

Heunie, also a soldier in the war of 1870-71. 
Dr. John, see forward. Nicholas and Dr. 
John Pittz are the only surviving members 
of the family (1910). 

(II) Dr. John Pittz, son of John (i) Pittz, 
was born July 16, 1844. He was educated in 
the public schools. He was but a boy when 
an epidemic of fever carried off hundreds of 
the residents of his province, among them 
many of his own relatives. The boy seems to 
have been born with an aptitude for treating 
diseases. He gave water to the sick, although 
this was strictly forbidden by the physicians. 
He did it out of pure sympathy, and observ- 
ing that in every case they seemed to ex- 
perience relief he gave them cool water in 
abundance and his four cases all recovered. 
When the war between Prussia and Austria 
was being waged he was drawn and assigned 
to hospital duty. Although without medical 
knowledge his natural aptitude made him a 
valuable assistant, and he gained valuable ex- 
perience. He decided to adopt medicine for 
his profession. In August, 1869, he left home- 
and came to the United States, landing from 
the steamship "America" in New York, after 
a passage of eleven days. He proceeded tO' 
Albany, where he soon afterwards began the 
study of medicine under Dr. Albert Van Der- 
veer, and in 1872 was granted a diploma and 
state license to practice. He is a very suc- 
cessful physician and has a large practice all 
over the city. His success in fever cases is 
marked, few being lost. He is identified with 
the medical societies, and with the local Ger- 
man singing society, Cecilia and Harmonica. 
He is a trustee of the German Veteran As- 
sociation, and a prominent and popular mem- 
ber of German life and society. 

He married (first) Theresa Whitemier, 
who died soon after her marriage. He mar- 
ried (second), in 1878, Louise Heisler, born' 
in Albany. August i, 1859, of German parent- 
age. Her father, Martin Heisler, born No-

Mount" for the ten persons in his family, Feb- 
ruary 24. 1639-40. Henry Adams died in 
Braintree. October 6, 1646. His descendants 
have probably filled more high public ofiices 
in the L'nited States and rendered greater pub- 
lic service than the descendants of any other 
man who ever landed on the coast of Amer- 
ica. Every page of American history is en- 
riched by the deeds of an Adams. They 
alone can point to a son succeeding his father 
as president of the L^nited States, namely : 
John Adams and John Ouincy Adams, also 
Charles Francis Adams, who served as minis- 
ter to England. In law. business, church or

5. Peter, see forward. 6. John ;' there is a 
grave doubt as to John being a son of Henry

sixth son. Thayer says : "John was in Chelms- 
ford 1654, after which we are not able to 
trace him." President John Quincy .Adams 
(see his letter in Gen. Reg. vol. XXXI\', p. 
67) says the ten persons in Henrv .Adams

1640, were himself, wife, daughter and seven

was not only a leading manufacturer of the 
city, and one of her most active, progressive 
business men, but was a most prominent and 
well-known citizen in public olificial life. He 
was elected the first mayor of Colioes under 
the city charter, was president of the water 
board that gave to Cohoes its wonderful sys- 
tem of water power supply that turns the 
wheels of industry in so many mills in that 
city. He was president of the First National 
Bank of the city of Cohoes many years ; presi- 
dent of the National Knit Goods Association, 
in fact while in Colioes was interested in all 
that pertained to the welfare of the city. He 
invested heavily in real estate, built the Eg- 
berts Woolen ]\Iills, presented the city with a 
much needed steam engine "as an expression 
of my personal interest in the welfare of the 
community." ("Adams steamer" is still in 
service, doing valiant service and successfully 
competes with newer rivals.) He built busi- 
ness blocks, fostered new enterprises, and was 
one of the purchasers of Grandview Park, 
and had it laid out as a park for the use of 
the city. He was greatly appreciated in the 
city, and when he returned from Europe, 
during his incumbency of the mayor's office, 
was accorded a most enthusiastic and cordial 
public reception. When the news of his death 
was made public, the flags on the City Hall 
were displayed at half mast and the general 
grief was most remarkable. Mr. Adams had 
a most distinguished political career. He was 
aide-de-camp with rank of colonel to Gov- 
ernor Hunt in 185 1, member of the assembly 
in 1857 : state senator, 1872-73 : member of 
congress from the Albany district, 1876. He 
was presidential elector in 1873, 3"'! was ap- 
pointed by President Grant United States 
commissioner to the World's Fair and Expo- 
sition in Vienna, 1873. About the year 1880 
he removed to New York City, where he 
continued to be interested in business. There 
he was president of the Mercantile Corpora- 
tion of the United States and South Africa ; 
director of the Bank Clerk's Corporation 
Building and Loan Association, and trustee 
of the Metropolitan Savings Bank, retaining 
as well his large interests in Cohoes. He was 
truly a man of affairs, and had many interests 
in life outside business and politics. He had 
artistic and scientific tastes that he gratified, 
and held memberships in the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art and the American Geograph- 
ical Society. He was proud of his descent 
from a famous ancestry, and connected him- 
self with the New York Genealogical and 
Biographical Society, and the Sons of the 
American Revolution. His social interests 
were conserved by membership in the Metro- 



politan Club and St. Nicholas Club of New 
York. He was of a most charitable and ben- 
evolent disposition, but so modest and retir- 
ing that his benefactions were known only to 
the giver and the beneficiary. 

He married, September 15, 1853, Eliza- 
beth, daughter of William Barnes Piatt, of 
Rhinebeck, New York. She died in 1866, 
leaving two children : Mary Egberts, born in 
Rhinebeck, New York, 1854, married Robert 
Johnston, of Cohoes, who died two years 
later, leaving a son Robert; William Piatt 
Adams, see forward. He married (second) 
Judith Crittenden, daughter of Chapman and 
Mary (Crittenden) Coleman, of Louisville, 
Kentucky. Children : Agnes Ethel ; Judith 
Berlina (Mrs. E. C. Converse, Jr.). 

(IX) William Piatt, only son of Hon. 
Charles Henry and Elizabeth (Piatt) Adams, 
was born in Rhinebeck. New York, February 
18, 1859. He is a lineal descendant of Presi- 
dents John and John Quincy Adams. Through 
his great-grandmother, Christina (Van Ber- 
gen) Adams, he is descended from Captain 
Martin \'an Bergen, who came from Holland 
in 1630, and also from Major Derrick Wessel 
Ten Broeck, mayor of Albany. His great- 
great-grandmother, Nellie Salisbury Van Ber- 
gen, was a great-granddaughter of the famous 
Admiral Salisbury ; his grandmother, .Agnes 
(Egberts) Adams, was a daughter of An- 
thony Egberts, who was an officer in the 
American army during the revolutionary war, 
and a sister of Egbert Egberts, the father of 
the knit goods industry in Cohoes, first presi- 
dent of the National Bank of Cohoes and the 
donor of Egberts Institute to the city. 

William Piatt Adams was educated at De 
Garmo Academy at Rhinebeck, from which he 
was graduated 1875. After finishing his pre- 
paratory course he matriculated at L'nion Col- 
lege, where he made an enviable record, 
graduating A.B., class of 1879. He won 
both the Clark and Allen prizes for excellence 
in literary work and was chosen class orator. 
He was prominent also in athletics, and on 
several occasions brought his college colors 
first over the winning line in running con- 
tests. In 1880 he formed a i)artnership with 
John L. Newman, of Albany, for the manu- 
facture of knit underwear, locating their mills 
at Cohoes, which has since been his home. 
This connection with Mr. Newman existed 
ten years, when both retired and have not 
since been actively engaged in public business. 
He represented his father's interests in Co- 
hoes, the latter having removed to New York. 
Since his father's death, in 1902, he has repre- 
sented and managed the .\dams estate, con- 
sisting of mills, business blocks and other im-

proved and unimproved real estate. He di- 
rects and manages his own private estate and 
serves as director of the First National Bank 
of Cohoes, and the Commerce Insurance Com- 
pany of Albany. He also has large real estate 
interests in Rhinebeck, New York. His taste 
for travel is abundantly gratified by frequent 
journeys at home and abroad, one tour of 
Europe and foreign lands extending over a 
period of three years, accompanied by his 
family. He is a Republican in politics, but 
the Adams love of public life and prominence 
is not one of his characteristics. In 1909 he 
was appointed by Governor Hughes one of 
the commissioners of the Hudson-Fulton cele- 
bration, October to November, 1909, and 
chairman of the committee to accompany the 
Governor on his up-river trip from New 
York City to Cohoes. At the latter city, 
which was the culmination point of the cele- 
bration. Governor and Mrs. Hughes were en- 
tertained during their stay by Mr. and Mrs. 
Adams at their beautiful home. In 1910 he 
is a trustee of Union College, and a member 
of the Graduate Council. He is a member 
and an elder of the Dutch Reformed church 
of Cohoes. He is a member of the college 
fraternitv. Alpha Delta Phi, and of the Alpha 
Delta Phi Club of New York City. He has 
been a member of the County and Castle 
Club, Isle of Wight, England ; the St. Nich- 
olas of New York City, and is a member of 
the Waterford Country Club ; University Club 
of Albany, of Troy Chapter, Sons of the 
Revolution, Dutchess County Society of New 
York, and the American Club in Paris. 

He married, January 23, 1884, at Red 
Hook, New York, Katherine Whiteman, born 
at Red Hook, daughter of Jacob W. Elseffer, 
born in Red Hook, September 6, 183 1, died 
November 15, 1907, a prominent attorney of 
Dutchess county, New York, and descendant 
of a family founded in that county a century 
and a half ago. In 1580 Louis Elzvier, a 
printer, left Germany for Holland to escape 
religious agitations, and soon thereafter books 
bearing the imprint of "Elzvier" appeared. He 
had seven sons, five following the business 
of their father and becoming distinguished 
therein, and the other two returning to the 
highlands of Germany. From this noted fam- 
ily of printers, whose fame spread through- 
out the civilized world as the printers of the 
Elzvierian Bibles, a male descendant came to 
America in 1738 and settled in Rhinebeck. 
Since then the now Elseffer family have been 
prominent in Dutchess county, holding vari- 
ous high positions in financial and political 
life. Through the Wliitemans the Elseffers 
are descended from Jacob Sharpe, who had 



conveyed to him and others by Governor 
Hunter in 1710 six thousand acres of land 
in Columbia county, in trust for themselves 
and the other Palatines. Jacob W. Elseffer 
married Delia Eliza Bonesteel, born at Clare- 
mont, Columbia county, New York. Chil- 
dren of \\'illiam Piatt and Katherine W. 
(Elseffer) Adams: Elizabeth Piatt and Kath- 
erine Elseffer. 

(The Piatt Line). 

The Platts were prominent in England in 

the time of Edward III. In the records of 

the Heraldry office in London it is called the 

ancient and honorable family of Piatt. 

(I) Richard Piatt was of English birth, 
and came to America in 1638, landing at 
New Haven, Connecticut. He was one of 
the founders of the town of Milford. where 
he was a landowner and deacon of the first 
church in 1669. His estate inventoried six 
hundred pounds sterling. He died in 1684. 
Children : Mary, John, Isaac and Sarah, born 
in England : Epenetus. Hannah, Josiah and 
Josiah, baptized in Milford. Isaac and Epen- 
etus settled at Huntington, Long Island. 

(II) Epenetus, son of Richard and Mary 
Piatt, was recorded as one of the land hold- 
ers of Hutington, Long Island, in 1666. With 
his brother Isaac he was imprisoned by the 
tyrannical Governor Andros. He was known 
as Captain Epenetus. In 1667 he married 
Phebe Wood, and died in 1693. His children

William L. Elseffer, all of whom had dis- 
tinguished careers. Jacob W. studied law and

1513- 



1757. Little is known of his youthful clays. He 
was well educated, as is proven by his after 
career. At the outbreak of the revolution he 
warmly advocated the cause of the colonies 
and at the first opportunity entered the ser- 
vice. South Carolina, "beinj^ in want of sea- 
men," offered inducements to the young man 
through Elijah Freeman Payne, who fur- 
nished him with enlistment papers. Payne 
was then lieutenant of a twenty-gun ship, 
"The Randolph," lying at Charleston. South 
Carolina, coinmanded by Captain Cockran. 
He promised Hall a lieutenancy in the marine 
department provided he would enlist fifteen 
men and transport them to Providence, Rhode 
Island. Entering upon his task with energy, 
he secured twenty-nine men and a boy, resi- 
dents of Barnstable county, procured a 
schooner and conveyed his recruits to Provi- 
dence. At Stonington a vessel was procured 
with cannon and stores, named the "Eagle," 
and in her Captain Payne and Lieutenant Hall 
put to sea, intending to cruise to Charleston 
and there join "The Randolph." They took 
several prizes, one of them "The Spears," 
being placed in command of Lieutenant Hall 
as prize master. The ships became separated 
and the prisoners on board greatly outnum- 
bered the crew, mutinied and on September 
13' 1776, obtained control of the ship. They 
arrived at Glasgow, Scotland, and Lieutenant 
Hall was delivered to the city authorities, who 
ordered him imprisoned. Through Masonic 
friends whom he found in power he received 
many favors and was given unusual liberties. 
In April, 1777, he was released : on his way 
home, and within sight of the Virginia coast, 
when the vessel on which he was a passenger, 
"The Duke of Grafton," was captured by a 
P)ritish man-of-war of sixty-four guns, "The 
St. Albans," and the lieutenant was again a 
prisoner. His second captivity lasted only 
ten days. Through the efforts of Patrick 
Henry, then governor of Virginia, he was ex- 
changed and provided with a horse and money 
to enable him to reach ]\Iassachusetts. Many 
years afterward his descendants received pay 
for his naval services. On leturning to 
Barnstable he began the study of law and 
remained there until 181 2, when he removed 
to Vermont, first settling at Bennington. In 
1783 he was at Westminister. He rose to 
eminence in his profession : was elected to the 
\'ermont general assembly, 1789-91-92 and 
1808. In 1792 he was presidential elector 
and with his colleagues cast the vote of his 
state for George Washington and John 
Adams. He was. a fellow of Middlebury Col- 
lege, a member of the council of censors, and 
for seven years, 1794- 1801, was judge of the 



supreme court of the state. Of Judge Hall it 
was written: "He is one of the judges of 
the Supreme Court, which office he fills in 
such a manner as to reflect honor on even scv 
important a station." He died May 17, 1809, 
in his fifty-third year. He married.' in Boston, 
February 13, 1786, Mary Homer, of that city, 
an orphan, only fifteen years of age. She 
outlived her husband many years, died Feb- 
ruary 21, 1843, aged seventy-two vears. 
Under the title "A True Story," a romantic 
account of her courtship and marriage ap- 
peared in the Herald of Freedom in Decem- 
ber, 1789. The "A True Story" was again 
printed in the Barnstable Journal in August, 
1829, and reprinted in the Troy Daily Post,. 
February 21, 1845. 

(VII) Daniel (2), eldest child of Lot (2) 
and Mary (Polly) (Homer) Hall, was born' 
in Westminster, Vermont, 1787, died in Troy, 
New York, December 10, 1868. He was edu- 
cated at the University of \'ermont, and in 
1804 came to Troy, New York, where he 
began the study of law with A. Paine. He 
was admitted to the bar of New York and 
was actively engaged in the practice of his 
profession in Troy all his life. He was a 
careful, painstaking lawyer, a safe counsellor, 
but not an advocate. His was largely an 
office business and his clients" interests were 
well safeguarded. He was a Whig, and on 
the formation of the Republican party be- 
came an active, earnest worker in that or- 
ganization. He was a very strict observer of 
religious forms and always insisted that his 
family accompany him to public worship. He 
married Anjinette Fitch. She was a descend- 
ant of Thomas Fitch, the emigrant ancestor 
who came from Bocking, Essex county, Eng- 
land, with his widowed mother in 1635-38. 
He was in Norwalk, 1652. He is the ances- 
tor of Thomas Fitch, governor of Connec- 
ticut, and of all the family of Fitch claiming 
Norwalk ancestors. Children of Daniel and 
Anjinette (Fitch) Hall: Mary Olivia, died 
1909, aged over seventy years ; Fitz Edward, 

married, in India, < Sherldham and 

had several children : George Canning, born 
March 29, 1828, married Mary Marvin; 
Benjamin Homer, of whom further: Richard 
Fitch, of whom further; James Stephenson, 
of whom further.

was admitted to the bar in 1856. He was 
in the active practice of his profession in 
Troy from 1856 to 1893. He was city cham- 
berlain of Troy, 1884-85. He was a well- 
known author and a poet of local prominence, 
his works of that kind that are preserved 
being largely of a humorous nature. One of 
his poems, entitled "The Tale of the Whale," 
was published in the September number of 
Ottr Young Folks in 1866.' In it the author 
blends in verse the strange names of the con- 
temporary people of Rensselaerwyck in the 
quotations, describing the inspection of the 
^reat mammal (cast ashore on Whale Island, 
opposite Lansingburg in 1647) a-^d the dis- 
position made of its blubber; another read 
during the Centennial Celebration at Troy, on 
"The Naming and Progress of Troy," thus 
described the reception of the name at Albany. 

"But when next day a shallop, 

Sailed proudly down the stream, 
And brought the news that Troy 

Xo longer was a dream, 
The streets were all deserted. 

Each true Albanian wailed, 
A fast day was appointed. 

Five sturgeon vendors failed," 

Verse, however, was his recreation. For 
two years he was editor of the Troy Morning 
Whig, 1878-79. He published anonymously 
while at Harvard "A Collection of College 
Words and Customs," and on the authorship 
"becoming known, Jared Sparks, president of 
Harvard, presented him with three histories 
of Harvard, then extant, inserting in each 
volume, "Presented to Mr. Benjamin H. Hall, 
"by the Corporation of Harvard University, 
June 18, 1851. Jared Sparks, president." In 
1856 he revised the work. He published "A 
History of Eastern Vermont" (1858, new edi- 
tion 1865), "Bibliography of the United 
States," Vermont (i860) ; "A Tribute of the 
Citizens of Troy to the A^emory of Abraham 
Lincoln" (1865), and articles in the Harvard 
Book (1875) and in Sylvester's History of 
Rensselaer County, New York (1880). He 
was an eloquent, forceful orator and many of 
"his orations survive in published form. He 
was president of the Young Men's Associa- 
tion of Troy, and at their Semi-Centennial, 
December 12, 1884, read a most effective and 
interesting sketch of the, association. lie took 
an active part in the Troy Centennial, de- 
livered eulogies on Hon. John Paine Cush- 
man, David Buel, Jr., and William L. Marcy, 
on Historical Day, and on another day ad- 
dresses on Troy's "two great teachers," 
Emma Willard and Amos Eaton. He built 
the then immense "Hall Building" in Troy in 
1871, that is yet a noticeable feature of Troy's 



business streets. "A cultured, polished gen- 
tleman, an able lawyer and a true friend." 
He married, June i, 1859, Margaret McConn,

This family name is of Saxon 
H.\LL origin. The settlers in England 

from the region about the city of 
Halle, in Saxony, for sake of distinction be- 
fore the use of surnames, were called de 
Halle, which became shortened to Halle, and 
finally to Hall. .\ large number of the name 
came to New England during the Puritan 
e.xodus from England prior to 1650. The 
name became common in Connecticut, and has 
been worthily borne. From among the many 
there recorded the family mentioned here 
seems to stand alone. The names and loca- 
tions are different, and cannot belong to other 
branches. Among the first to settle in Con- 
necticut were Josiah, Zadoc, Bashni and Libni 
Hall, supposedly brothers, who came from

(The Cady Line). 
The word Cady is derived from Ca-dia, a 
Gaelic word, meaning the House of God. 
Cadie is an old Scotch word for messenger*. 
As a surname the word has been variously 
spelled. Cade, Caddie, Caddy, Cadye, Kayde, 
Cadey and Cady, and, of course, in a variety 
of other less common forms. Families of 
this name bearing coats-of-arms of some an- 
tiquity are found in counties Essex, Kent, 
Suffolk and Gloucester, England. The sur- 
name is found in the ancient Hundred Rolls 
and was not uncommon as early as 1450 in 
county Sussex. 

(I) Nicholas Cady, immigrant ancestor, 
was born in England, came to this country, 
landing near Boston, Massachusetts, 1635, 
later settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. 
He and John Knapp, who appears to have 
been a relative, bought of William Potter, of 
\V'atertown, December 8, 1645, a house and 
land in Watertown. Cady deeded his share 
to John Knapp in August, 1650. Nicholas 
Cady married (first) Judith, daughter of Wil- 
liam Knapp, about 1648. William Knapp was 
a carpenter ; died at Watertown, August 30, 
1658, aged about eighty years. Nicholas 
Cady married (second) Priscilla Akers. 
widow of Thomas Akers. He took the oath of 
fidelity in 1652; was of the train band in 
1653. He removed to Groton, Alassachusetts. 
early in 1668, and sold his land in Watertown. 
He was highway surveyor at Groton in 1671. 
At the time of the abandonment of the town 
in King Philip's war, he went to Cambridge, 
where in 1678 he bought a farm of John 
Wincoll. He was a soldier in King Philip's 
war and was in Mr. Williams' garri.son. He 
returned to Groton after the war and served 
as surveyor in 1680-83-85-86. He was con- 
stable in 1685 and was corporal of the mili- 
tary company. He died prior to 171 2. Cady's 
pond, about a mile from the village of Groton, 
takes its name from him. Children, born at 
\\'atertown: John, January 15. 1650-51; 
Judith, September 2, 1653; James, August 28, 
1655: Nicholas, August 2. 1657, died young; 
Daniel, November 27, 1659; Ezekiel, August 
14, 1662; Nicholas, February 20, 1663-64; 
Joseph, mentioned below. 

(II) Captain Joseph, .son of Nicholas Cady, 
was born at Watertown, May 28, 1666. He 
married Sarah, daughter of Samuel and Mary 
(Waters) Davis, of (Proton, born August 12, 
1667, died at Killingly, Connecticut, Decem- 
ber 29. 1742. He went to Groton with the 
family when a child and served in the garrison 
defense of the town in 1691-92. In 1695 he 
was constable of Groton, and in 1699-1701 
was granted permission to keep an inn by the 



general court. He sold his holdings at Gro- 
ton, February 22, 1702-03, and bought one- 
hundred and fifty acres of land of Johm 
Chandler, of Woodstock, later Killingly, now 
Putnam, Connecticut, whither he went with 
his family and where he spent the remainder 
of his life. His farm was located north of 
the old Providence road, about one mile east 
of the village of Putnam. The site of the 
first log house can still be identified. He built 
a frame house in 1714 and at last accounts 
it was still standing, though not occupied. A 
short time before his death, Joseph Cady, Jr., 
sold this homestead to Darius Session, deputy 
governor of Rhode Island. In 1708 Joseph 
Cady, Sr., was chosen lieutenant of the train 
band of Aspinock ; in 1721 he was commis- 
sioned captain, and was engaged in Father 
Rasle's war. He was noted for his giant 
frame and physical prowess and gained great 
influence over the Indians. Tliis story is told' 
of him : "As Joseph Cady was one day cut- 
ting brush alone, an Indian approached him 
from the neighboring forest and expressed a 
strong desire to try the skill of a white man 
in wrestling. Cady thought to himself that 
if he could throw the fellow it might operate- 
to deter the Indians from hostilities against 
the settlements, and accepted the challenge. 
Both men struggled long and desperately, but 
Cady at last prevailed and the Indian was 
prostrated. L'nfortunately he fell among the 
brush which his antagonist had been cutting, 
and one of the sharp stumps perforating his 
skull, he died on the spot." Captain Cady 
had charge of the public lands of Killingly 
for many years and was useful in public af- 
fairs. He was townsman in 1728 and deputy 
to the general court, 1731-34. Children, of

In Herald's College, Lon- 
WASHBURN don, vol. i. p. 54, is given: 
Washbourne, "A name of 
ancient Norman descent ; the founder was 
knighted on the field of battle by William the 
Conqueror and endowed with the lands of 
Little Washbourne and Great Washbourne, 
counties of Gloucester and Worcester." 
Burke's General Armory gives : Washbourne, 
county of Worcester, a family of knightly de- 
gree, previous to time of Edward HI. * * * 
Arms: "Argent on a fess between si.x mart- 
letts gules, three cinquefoils of the field." 
Crest : "On a wreath a coil of flax argent, 
surmounted with another wreath argent and 
Gules, thereon flames of fire proper." Motto: 
"Perseverd decogue confide." The name is 
derived from two words — wash, the swift cur- 
rent of a stream, burn or bourne, a brook or 
stream. The name is still spelled Wash- 
bourne in England, but in .'\merica Washburn 
is almost universal. The earliest form of the 
name was "de Wassebourne." 

John Washborne was the first secretary of 
the Plymouth council in England and was suc- 
ceeded by William Burgess in 1628. Whether

the same John ever came to America is a 
matter over which genealogists differ. In 
America the name is a distinguished one. 
Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts and Wiscon- 
sin have all had governors from the Wash- 
burn family ; three brothers served as con- 
gressmen from three states at the same time, 
and some of the nation's greatest men in civil 
and private life, statesmen, soldiers in all 
American wars, have borne the name. The 
emigrant ancestor of all the early New Eng- 
land families was John Washburn, there being 
strong probability and grave doubt as to 
whether he was the Secretary John Wash- 
borne previously mentioned or not. 

(I) John Washburn, born at Eversham, 
Worcester, England, settled in Duxbury, 
Massachusetts, in 1632. He and his son John, 
who came later, were among the fifty-four 
original proprietors of Bridgewater. Massa- 
chusetts, in 1645. They bought the lands 
from the Indian sachem, Massasoit, for seven 
coats of one and one-half yards each, nine 
hatchets, twenty knives, four moose skins, 
ten and one-half yards of cotton cloth. The 
transfer was signed by Miles Standish, Sam- 
uel Nash and Constant Southworth. He died 
at Bridgewater in 1690. His wife Margery 
bore him John and Philip, the latter born in 
1624, died unmarried. 

(II) John (2), son of John (i) and Mar- 
gery Washburn, was born at Eversham, 
Worcester, England, in 162 1 ; married Eliza- 
beth, daughter of Experience Mitchell. By 
the marriage the Washburn descendants gain 
"Mayflower" ancestry, through Francis Cook, 
the Pilgrim. Jane, daughter of Francis Cook, 
married Experience Mitchell, and their daugh- 
ter married John Washburn (2). John (2) 
was eleven years old when he came to Amer- 
ica with his mother and brother Philip on the 
ship "Elizabeth." Experience Mitchell was 
with the Pilgrims at Leyden and came to 
Plymouth in the third ship, the "Anne," 1623. 
Children of John (2) and Elizabeth Wash- 
burn : John, married Rebecca Lapham : 
Thomas, married (first) Abigail Leonard; 
(second) Deliverance Packard; Joseph, mar- 
ried Hannah Latham, granddaughter of Mary 
Chilton, "the first to land at Plymouth from 
the Mayflower"; Samuel, born 1651. married 
Deborah Packard ; Jonathan, married Mary 
Vaughn ; Benjamin, served in Chipps expedi- 
tion against Canada ; Mary, married Samuel 
Kingsley. 1694; Elizabeth, married (first) 
James Howard; (second) Edward Sealey; 
Jane, married William Orcutt (2) ; James, 
married Mary Bowdcn, 1693; Sarah, married 
John Ames, 1697. John Washburn (2) died 
at Bridgewater before 1690. Samuel, his 



fourth son, was the ancestor of the Wash- 
burns of Maine. In that line the next seven 
generations bore the name of Israel, Joseph, 
third son of John (2), was the ancestor of 
ex-Governor Washburn of ]\Iassachusetts, 
1853. Samuel was also the progenitor of the 
family in Albany, New York, herein recorded. 

(III) Samuei, son of John (2) and Eliza- 
beth (jNIitchell) Washburn, was born in Dux- 
bury, Massachusetts, 165 1, died 1720, at 
Bridgewater. He was called "Sergeant Wash- 
burn." He married Deborah, daughter of 
Samuel Packard, who came from Windham, 
England, on the ship "Delight of Ipswich," 
and settled at Hingham, Massachusetts, 1638. 
Children: Samuel (2) ; Noah, married Eliza- 
beth Shaw ; Israel, married Waitstill Sum- 
mer; Nehemiah, see forward; Benjamin, mar- 
ried Joanna or Susanna Orcutt ; Hannah, mar- 
ried Joseph Keith. 

(IV) Nehemiah, son of Samuel and De- 
borah (Packard) Washburn, was born 1686, 
at Bridgewater, Massachusetts ; married, 1713, 
Jane Howard, and had issue. 

(V) Nehemiah (2), son of Nehemiah (i) 
and Jane (Howard) Washburn, married Re- 
lief, born September 21, 1729, daughter of 
John and Lydia (Lincoln) Joy, of Hingham, 
Massachusetts (see Joy V). Relief Joy was 
a sister of Lydia Joy. who married Timothy 
Edson, of Bridgewater, Massachusetts, and 
removed to Stafford, Connecticut. 

(VI) William Edson, son of Nehemiah (2) 
and Relief (Joy) Washburn, was born in 
Connecticut, about 1750. He appears in Ot- 
sego county, New York, during the revolu- 
tionary period, in the towns of Milford and" 
Westford. The Edsons also were early set- 
tlers in Otsego county, settling in Milford, 
where there was a hamlet known as Edson's 
Corners. The Edsons and Washburns were 
connected by marriage and seem to have been 
close friends. William E. Washburn pur- 
chased land, married, reared a family and 
was a prosperous, respected farmer. 

(VII) Fliram Lucius, son of William Ed- 
son Washburn, was a contractor and builder. 
He removed to Albany, where he carried on- 
extensive building operations. He was the 
builder of a great many churches in the vicin- 
ity of Albany, and prospered. He later re- 
tired to a farm in Montgomery county. New 
York, in the section early farmed by the In- 
dians, also the scene of some of the fights 
with .Sir John Johnson and his Indian-Tory 
allies. Here he ended his days. He married 
Magdalcna T. Clark, and had issue. A tra- 
dition in the family is that the branch of the 
Clark family descended from a Sergeant 
Clark, of the English army, who when the 



HUDSON AND AIOHAWK VALLEYS 



isig- 



British evacuated New York was too sick to 
be moved, was left behind, recovered, re- 
mained in America, married and reared a 
family. 

(\'III) Hiram Lucius (2), son of Hi- 
ram Lucius (i) and Magdalena T. (Clark) 
Washburn, was born in Westford, Otsego 
county. New York, June 14, 1840, died in 
Albany, September 5, 1904. He was edu- 
cated in the schools of Albany and at Ballston 
Institute. He studied law with Hungerford 
& Hotaling, attorneys, of Albany, and in 
1862 was admitted to practice at the Albany 
county bar, continuing in practice until his 
death. He was connected with several of 
the loan associations of that period between 
i860 and 1875 at Albany, and spent a great 
amount of time in the office of the county 
clerk, searching titles. He tried and won a 
famous case in New York legal reports in- 
volving the rights under the law of soldiers 
who had enlisted to fill unexpired terms. The 
decision in this case caused the United States 
government to suspend the granting of writs 
of "Habeas Corpus" for a period of six 
months, in order to hold soldiers to their en- 
listments, should they seek that remedy. He 
was greatly interested in the New York Na- 
tional Guard, and was instrumental in im- 
proving the marksmanship of the soldiers. He 
was inspector of rifle practice with the rank 
of major on the general stafif for ten years, 
and spent a large amount of his time in the 
performance of his duty. He was on duty 
at the time of the West Albany riots. He 
was at various times connected with the 
Third, Fifth and Ninth brigades, New York 
National Guard. He was a member of the 
Masonic order, belonging to Master's Lodge, 
No. 6, Free and Accepted Masons ; De Witt 
Clinton Council, Royal and Select Masters. 
He was a member of the Episcopal church. 
He married. April 18. 1866. Phebe, daughter 
of Joseph B. and Elizabeth (Holmes) Neemes, 
of Albany. Joseph B. Neemes was born in 
Cumberland county, England, and Elizabeth 
Holmes was of Welsh descent, born in Ches- 
ter, England. Children : Lucius Hiram, see 
forward : Elizabeth W., married Dr. William 
J. McKown, a practicing physician of Al- 
bany ; Katherine W.. married. June 3, 1896, 
Randall J. Le Eoeuf, son of Peter J. and 
Sarah A. (Saunders) Le Boeuf. 

(IX) Lucius Hiram, son of Hiram Lucius 
(2) and Phebe (Neemes) Washburn, was 
born in Albany, New York. January 12, 1869. 
He was educated in the public schools of Al- 
bany, and graduated from the high school. 
He studied law with his father and was ad- 
mitted to the Albany county bar, July 7, 1896. 



He has been continuously in practice from 
that date in Albany. His practice is general,

(The Joy Line). 

The earliest mention of Thomas Joy. the 
immigrant ancestor of most of the Joy fam- 
ilies in America, is found in tlie records of 
Boston, Massachusetts. He was born in Eng- 
land, about 1610, came to America between 
the years 1629-40. He was an architect and" 
builder. Until 1646 he was a prosperous, 
successful man. In that year his independent 
spirit brought him into collision with the es- 
tablished authorities, with disastrous results. 
His principal resistance was against the nar- 
row policy of the colonial government which- 
restricted the right of suffrage to the mem- 
bers of the local Puritan churches. He failed' 
in his efforts, removed his family to Hing- 
ham. and made his home in the Rev. Peter 
Hobart's parish. He afterward regained his 
fallen fortune, returned to Boston in 1656, 
and in 1657, in company with Bartholomew 
Bernard, was awarded the contract to build' 
the first "Town House" of Boston, which 
links his name forever with an interesting and 
historical edifice. This first capitol of ^iassa- 
chusetts stood for half a century. It was de- 
stroyed by fire in 171 1. and on its site was 
erected the "Old State House," one of the 
most venerated monuments of Colonial Bos- 
ton. Thomas Joy died October 21. 1678, 
aged sixty-nine years. He and his wife were 
buried in the Plingham churchyard back of 
the meeting house, which still stands, the most 
ancient Protestant church in the United 
States. He married Joan Gallup (Gallop), 
born in England, daughter of Captain John 
and Christabel Gallup. Captain John Gallup 
came from England in 1630 in the ship "Mary 
and John." He was a skillful pilot and Indian 
trader of dauntless courage, and distinguished 
himself on many occasions in the Indian war- 
fare constantly going on. His trading shallop 
was the principal means of communication 
between the Bay Colony and the settlement on 
Narragansett bay and Long Island sound.

farm, which on the death of Samuel came 
to him as a legacy. The property then was

The Long Island families of the 
HICKS name of Hicks are of English de- 
scent. The English ancestor of 
the family is traditionally stated to have been 
a Sir Ellice Hicks, who fought under the

Black Prince in France and was made a knight 
banneret by King Edward HI. for capturing 
a French standard at the battle of Crecy, 
when he is said to have a grant of the arms 
herein described : Arms. — Gules, a fess wavy 
argent there fleur de lys or. Crest : A buck's 
head, couped at the neck or, forged with a 
chaplet of cinquefoils vert. Motto: "Sem- 
per paratus." 

During the turbulent reign of Charles I. 
many of the family crossed over to Holland 
for refuge from persecution. In 1641 three 
brothers, Thomas, John, and Robert Hicks, 
settled in the town of Flushing, Long Island, 
coming from Holland under an arrangement 
with the Dutch West India Company. Rob- 
ert Hicks went later to New England ; Tliom- 
as located in what is called Little Neck ; John 
was among the patentees of Flushing in 1645 
(as was Thomas), and also owned lands in 
Hempstead and was a subscribing witness to 
an ancient Indian deed there. Later he set- 
tled in that part of Hempstead now called 
Far Rockaway. Previous to 1650 both John 
and Thomas held offices, civil and military. 
Thomas Hicks was a captain of militia in 
1686, and in 1691 was the first judge of 
the county of Queens, appointed under the 
act of that year, holding the office until 1699. 
The descendants of these brothers are nu- 
merous on Long Island, where the village 
of Hicksville is yet found. Thomas had 
two wives, six sons and four daughters. 
Thomas, his eldest son. married Deborah, 
daughter of Daniel Whitehead, and settled 
at Bayside, Flushing. He had four sons and 
six daughters, of whom Thomas (3), the eld- 
est, succeeded his father in the ownership 
of the Bayside estate in 171 2. In 1738 he 
was appointed judge, and in 1749 first judge 
of Queens county, as then constituted, which 
office he held until 1777. He was a member 
of the state legislature from 1738 to 1775. 
It is from one of the sons of Thomas Hicks 
' (2) that the Granville, New York, family 
of Hicks descend. A noted descendant of 
John Hicks was Elias Hicks, the noted divine 
of the Society of Friends and founder of 
the branch called 'The Hicksites."

During the earlier generations of 

ROSA the family in America this family 

retained the original spelling, 

Roosa. The latter-day family, or at least some 



of them, spell it Rosa, which is the orthogra- 
phy used by the family in Schenectady herein 
recorded. It is one of the old Dutch families 
of the Hudson-Mohawk that settled first in 
Esopus, then in Albany and Schenectady. The 
sons of the emigrant all founded families and 
many of them still may be found in the same 
localities, settled by their earliest ancestors. 
Gelderland, in Holland, was the home of the 
emigrant ancestor. 

(I) Albert Heymanse (Albert, son of Hey- 
man) Roosa, was a farmer of Gelderland, 
Holland, where he married Wynije Allard, 
and had eight children, born in the "fader- 
land." He came with his entire family to 
America in the ship "Spotted Cow," arriving 
at New Amsterdam, April 15, 1660, and made 
permanent settlement at Esopus, New York, 
shortly afterward. He was a person of more 
than usual importance, for on May 16, 1661, 
he was appointed by Governor Stuyvesant 
one of the three "schepens," or magistrates, 
his associates being Evert Pels and Cornells 
Barentse Slecht. He brought with him from 
Holland considerable property, and soon "oc- 
cupied an influential position in the new set- 
tlement." In 1661 he was appointed one of 
the three commissioners to enclose the new 
village at Esopus, called Hurley. At the 
destruction of the village of Hurley, on June 
7, 1663, by the Indians, two of his children, 
with forty-three other women and children, 
were taken captive. The story of the rescue 
of these captives by the colonial forces, un- 
der command of Captain Martin Kreiger, is 
one of the most interesting episodes in the 
early history of New York. The records 
cite many instances of his participation in 
the early making of Kingston that show him 
to have been a leader. He rebelled against 
the tyrannies of Governor NichoUs, and in 
1667 a commission appointed by the governor, 
sat at Esopus. investigating the "mutiny at 
Esopus." Albert Heymanse Roosa, Cornells 
Barentse Slecht and two others were "found 
guilty of rebellious and mutinous riot" and 
were taken to New York for sentence. 
Nicholls, by advice of his council, on May 3, 
sentenced Roosa to he banished for life out 
of the government, and the others for shorter 
terms out of Esopus. .Albany and New York. 
All these sentences were subsequently modi- 
fied and the offenders returned. Governor 
Lovelace restored him to favor, and in 1669 
appointed him overseer of the town of Hurley, 
called New Dorp, or New \illage. "In 1673 
he was confirmed as one of the officers of 
Esopus by Governor Anthony Colve, and 
described as Captain Albert Heymans Roosa, 
who had been prominent in the riot of 1667."

ment as a clerk in a dry goods store, re- 
maining but a year. Returning to Broadal- 
bin he engaged in mercantile life as junior 
partner of Chase & Rosa, general merchants, 
at L'nion Mills. In 1868 he located at Vail's 
Mills, town of Northampton, Fulton county, 
where he purchased a general store, and 
through firm changes continued until 1880, 
when he disposed of the business (being then 
sole owner), and located at the village of 
Broadalbin, where in association with Charles 
Butler he engaged as Rosa & Buder in the 
hasdware business. Later Mr. Rosa conducted 
a gentlemen's furnishing store. In 1907 he 
disposed of his mercantile interests, having 
previously organized the Broadalbin Lumber 
Company, with which he is yet connected as 
principal owner. He has been successful in

Three towns in the United 
LOliiDELL States have been named after 

descendants of Simon Lob- 
dell, viz: Lobdell, Louisiana, near New Or- 
leans, where, in close proximity, reside de- 
scendants of Abraham James and John Little 
Lobdell, the jjioneer Lobdell settlers of Louisi- 
ana and Mississippi; Lobdell, Clinton county. 
New York, named from descendants of Jared 
Lobdell ; Lobdell, Kane county, Kansas, named 
after Charles E. Lobdell, formerly speaker of 
the Kansas House of Assembly, also a de- 
scendant of Jared Lobdell. 

(I) The name of Simon Lobdell appears 
among the "Afterplanters" names of Milford, 
Connecticut, about forty — a framed list of 
names which hangs in the town clerk's office at 
Milford. The best supposition is that he came 



as a young lad with a party from Hereford, 
England, near the Wales boundary, in 1645, 
and that his sisters, Ann and Elizabeth, came 
at the same time, but remained in Boston. 
From public records it appears that Simon 
Lobdell, in 1646, was given by the "first plant- 
ers"' a home lot containing a half acre of 
ground. In 1657 ^^^ took the freeman's oath 
at Hartford, Connecticut, and was a taxpayer 
of that place in 1667. He removed to Spring- 
field, Massachusetts, where his sisters were 
living, both having married and settled there. 
From 1666 to 1674 he was keeper of the prison 
in Springfield, and accumulated considerable 
property. In 1681 he purchased land (but did 
not settle) at Stony River, and in 1682, at 
Hull, Massachusetts. He returned to Milford, 
where his wife, Persis, was admitted :o the 
church January 7, 1677, and on April 9, 17 10; 
Simon united with the same church. He died 
at Milford prior to October 4, 1717, as on 
that date letters of administration were granted 
on his estate. In his will he styles himself 

Lieutenant. He married Persis , date 

unknown. Children: i. Mary, married David 
Wooster, born 1666, eldest son of Edward 
Wooster, of Milford ; children : Jerusha, 
Persis and Tamar. 2. Elizabeth, married Wil- 
liam Roberts. 3. Joshua, of whom further. 
4. Anna, born December i, 1674, unmarried 
at time of her father's death. 5. Rebecca, 
born at Springfield, Massachusetts, 1677; mar- 
ried Deliverance Downs, born 1669, son of 
John and I\Iars- Downs, of New Haven, Con- 
necticut ; children: Rebecca, Tohn, Mary and 
Elizabeth. 

(H) Joshua, only son of Simon and Persis 
Lobdell. was born at Springfield, Massachu- 
setts, December 23, 1671, died previous to Oc- 
tober 31, 1743, as on that date Caleb Lobdell 
agrees to assume the support of his mother, 
"Eunice, widow of Joshua Lobdell, deceased, 
late of Ridgefield." He married and lived in 
Milford, until after the death of his first wife, 
Mary, then in 171 2, with his children, re- 
moved to Ridgefield, Connecticut. He pur- 
chased, March 3, 1712, of James Brown, of 
Norwalk, one-twenty-ninth part of the town of 
Ridgefield. During the succeeding twenty or 
thirty years Joshua was continually adding to 
his estate by purchase from the proprietors 
or their grantors. He married (first), Au- 
gust 1 1, 1695, Governor Robert Treat perform- 
ing the ceremony, Mary, daughter of John and 
Alice Burwell, early settlers of Milford. He 
married (second), in 1713, Eunice, born 1689, 
daughter of Lieutenant John and Mary (Bene- 
dict) Olm.stead, of Norwalk, Connecticut.

Bradley and Nancy (Richardson) Lobdell, 
was born in old Montgomery county, now 
Benson, Hamilton county. New York, June 20, 
1832. He was educated in the public schools,, 
and until twenty-one years of age was en- 
gaged in farming. He then went West, and' 
for five years was in the lumber and real 
estate business. He went to Northville 
in 1859, and after a few years in the grain 
trade, began, in 1865, the manufacture of 
gloves and mittens, a business he conducted 
for twenty-three years with great success. 
He- was one of the board of charter members 
of the Fonda, Johnstown & Gloversville rail- 
road, and mainly instrumental in having the 
road built to Northville. Mr. Lobdell may- 
claim to be one of the fathers of forest preser- 
vation ; certainly he has not only talked and 
fought for their preservation, but has prob- 
ably restored a larger area than any other 
single individual. In 1870 he first conceived 
a plan of replanting the former forest, and 
since that time has bought large tracts of 
despoiled land, and now has growing on lands 
of his own a quarter of a million white pine 
trees, all scientifically cared for. His experi- 
ment was with thirty-two acres of shade 
maple and a few pines that had sprung up. 
He trimmed and cared for them and was sO' 
well pleased with their growth and develop- 
ment that he has since made pines a specialty. 
Since 1899 he has planted chestnut, white 
oak and black walnut on old meadow and 
pasture land. In 1902 he planted a large 
quantity of black walnut, besides other kind 
of timber. He is enthusiastic over his favor- 
ite, tree culture, and cheerfully gives of his 
vast fund of information and experience to 
those desiring to follow his example and re- 
store the waste places. He also owns large 
and valuable tracts of lands in Michigan. He 
is a Democrat in politics, and has served 
as town clerk and assessor. He is connected 
with the Masonic order in Northville, and is 
a member of the Episcopal church.

The history of the Resse- 
RESSEGUIE guie family is unknown 

prior to the settlement of 
the American progenitor at Norwalk, Con- 
necticut, but it is believed they descend from 
the De Resseguie family, of the province of 
Languedoc, in southern France, and of Tou- 
louse, capital city of the department of Haute 
Garonne. 

(I) Alexander Resseguie settled in Nor- 
walk, Connecticut, in 1709. Tradition says 
he was the younger son of Alexander Resse- 
guie. a Huguenot refugee from France, who 
brought with "him a small hair trunk contain- 
ing trtle deeds to property in France. Hop- 
ing to return and establish his claims, Alex- 
ander educated liis eldest son to the law, but 
his death at the age of twenty years so dis- 
heartened the father that he gave up his 
intention and passed the trunk and papers into 
the possession of a younger son. Later they 
were destroyed by fire. Another theory is 
that the family fled to England before com- 
ing to America, and that Alexander Resse- 
guie. a silk manufacturer of London. 1696, 
was the father of Alexander of Norwalk. As 
there is no previous record of a male Resse- 
guie in America, Alexander must be consid- 
ered the ancestor. He purchased land in 
Norwalk. April i, 1709, and frequently there- 
after. There is little record of his life save 
that of his possessions. He died in October, 
1772: his place of burial is unknown. He 
married, October 19. 1709. Sara, daughter of 
Pierre and Marguerite (Collinot) Bontecou, 

■of New York. She was born in France and 
came to New York with her parents in 1689, 
and died in May, 1757. The estate of Alexan- 
der inventoried £10.500, an immense sum in

The present is the third genera- 
WEST tion of this branch of the West 
family in the United States. None 
of the name, honorably as it has been borne, 
will be more gratefully remembered or ten- 
derly cherished than Hon. George West, of 
Ballston Spa, New York. 

George West was born in Brandon, Eng- 
land, February 17, 1823. He received a good 
common school education, and early in life 
began work in a paper mill, where he thor- 
oughly mastered the various processes of mak- 
ing paper. He married, in England, in Febru- 
ary, 1840, and having then reached his twenty- 
sixth year he came to the United States. For 
one year he was employed in New Jersey, then 
removed to Massachusetts, where he obtained 
a position in a large paper mill. He soon 
became manager of the mill, and in a very few 
years was admitted a partner. In 1861 he 
removed to Ballston Spa, New York, where 
he was superintendent of one of the large 
mills at Rock City Falls. It was now the 
period of the civil war, and the scarcity of 
cotton was being severely felt, particularly by 
the mills producing cotton bags; many mills 
closed, and the demand for flour sacks be- 
came very great. .\t this juncture Mr. West 
saw his great opportunity. Leasing an idle 



mill he announced that he would make bags 
of paper. All doubted that he could make 
them strong enough to carry in safety fifty 
pounds of flour. He very soon demonstrated 
that he could, and began the manufacture of 
manila paper bags, and employed Martin V. 
B. White, an ingenious mechanic, to make the 
first lot by hand. The bags were all that 
Mr. West claimed for them, and orders began 
to pour in. He erected a bag mill adjoining 
his paper mill at Rock City Falls, and with 
a slow hand process laid the foundation of 
his large business and fortune. After he 
had been operating by the hand process for 
several months, a man of ordinary appearance 
called at his office one day and told him he 
could construct a machine that would do the 
same work far more rapidly. Mr. West at 
once entered into a contract with his visitor 
to build such a machine in his mill. The 
man made his promises good, and within a 
few weeks the machine was in successful oper- 
ation. The mechanical principle of his first 
bag-making machine is the same upon which 
the wonderful machines of to-day are built. 
Mr. West was the pioneer paper-bag manu- 
facturer, a business which has grown to be 
one of the world's greatest industries. In 
1862 he purchased the Empire Mill at Rock 
City Falls, and in 1866 built the Excelsior 
Mill, at the same point, and from time to 
time, as business increased, built or purchased 
additional mills along the stream. The death 
of John Howey, in 1875, compelled the sale 
of his four cotton factories, his mansion in 
Ballston Spa, and a large number of tene- 
ment houses. Mr. West became the purchaser 
of the entire estate. He converted one of 
the factories into a paper mill and one into 
a bag mill. When the Milton avenue fac- 
tory was burned he replaced it with the large 
Union Mill. In 1880 he purchased the paper 
mill at Hadley on the Hudson, and erected 
another large mill. He was now the largest 
manufacturer of his specialties in the entire 
world. He owned and operated nine paper 
mills, a pulp mill and two mills making noth- 
ing but manila paper and paper bags. He 
admitted his son, George, and his son-in-law, 
Douglass W. Mabee, to the business, which 
in 1899 was sold in its entirety to the Union 
Bag and Paper Company, and Mr. West re- 
tired from active business after a career of 
unprecedented success. He died at his home 
on Milton avenue, September 20, 1901, in his 
seventy-ninth year. 

He gave a great deal of time to the pub- 
lic service. In 1871 he was elected to the 
state assembly, and re-elected 1872-73-74-75; 
in 1881 was elected to congress and 'served

two terms; was again elected in 188". He 
spent eleven years in office and declined all 
further honors. He was an ardent Republi- 
can, and always retained an active interest 
in political affairs. He was a member of 
the -Methodist Episcopal church, his liberality 
•enabling: that society to erect, in 1892. their 
present fine church in Rallston Spa. He con- 
tributed one-half the cost, besides giving: the 
pipe organ and other fixtures. He contrib- 
uted a princely sum toward the erection of 
a fine museum building at Round Lake, New 
York, and provided an endowment fund for 
its permanent support. His liberality toward 
every worthy cause was very great, and he 
left behind a most gracious memory. He was 
large in physique as well as mentally. He 
accomplished much and left the world better 
for his having lived in it. 

He married Louisa Rose, born in England ; 
six children, three of whom lived to adult life, 
■George. Walter S., and Florence L., who 
married D. W. Mabee, and has seven chil- 
■dren : Louise, George, Walter, Florence, Al- 
fred, David, Margaret. 

(H) George (2), son of George (i) and 
Louisa (Rose) West, was born February 17, 
1845. in Devonshire, England, died January 
23, 1906. He was engaged with his father 
in the manufacture of paper all his life, and 
in later years was his partner. He was an 
•eminently capable business man, and of fine 
mind and character. He married, June 13, 
1870. Emily Hewitt, born May 3, 1848, daugh- 
ter of Orrin and Cynthia (Hewitt) Hathorn, 
■oi Greenfield, Saratoga county. New York 
(see Hathorn VIII). Children: Fred Hath- 
orn, Walter Scott, and George (3) West. 

(The Hathorn Line). 
This name is spelled either Hathorne, 
Hathorn or Hawthorne, by members of the 
same family, descendants of William and John 
Hathorn, of early colonial record. There 
have been many distinguished men who have 
Ijorne the name, and the curse pronounced 
liy the husband of a woman who was being 
tried for witchcraft before Judge John 
Hathorn in Salem, seems to have spent its 
force long ago. There are ugly records of 
these trials, but it is probably to this one that 
the traditional curse is traceable, the husband 
having exclaimed that God would avenge his 
wife's sufferings. William, the father of John 
Hathorn (also a magistrate), spent the force 
■of his wrath against the Quakers, and was 
notorious for his remorselessness towards 
some of their women, "Annie Coleman and her 
four friends." Albeit, before being appointed 
a magistrate he had opposed the persecution 



of Quakers. Yet he is to be credited with 
the e.xecution of John Flint for killing an 
Indian, and to the protest against English 
interference with the internal affairs of New 
England, which sounded a note of independ- 
ence even at that early day.- 

(I) William and Sara Hathorn, of Bimfield. 
Berkshire, England, had eight children, three 
of whom, William, Eliza and John, emigrated 
to America. William, the eldest son, came 
over with Governor Winthrop's company in 
the "Arbella," and settled in Salem, ^lassa- 

chusetts, June 12, 1630. Eliza married 

Davenport. John came over in 1635 and set- 
tled in Salem. William became a man of 
great importance in the colony. He was 
deputy to general court ; major of the first 
regularly organized company, or train band, 
in Salem, and fought in the Indian campaigns ; 
was also a magistrate and sullied his fair fame 
by cruelly persecuting the Quakers, although, 
from the Puritan standpoint' they were doing 
God and the church a service. He died in 
1681, in his seventy-fourth year; will proved 
June 28, 1681. Children: A daughter, who 

married Helwise; Sarah, married, 

April 13, 1663, Joseph Coker ; Eleazer, married 
Abigail, daughter of Captain George Curwen; 
Nathaniel, born August 11, 1639; John, see 
forward; Anna, married Joseph Porter; Cap- 
tain William, married Sarah ; Eliza- 
beth, married Israel Porter. 

(II) John, son of William and Anne (Dav- 
enport) Hathorn, was born August 4, 1641, 
died May 10, 1717. He was deputy, colonel, 
magistrate, judge, and a cruel and remorseless 
leader in the witchcraft persecution. Much 
as we may feel like condemning these men 
for their cruel and often inhuman treatment 
of those brought under their authority, all 
admit that they founded a state and reared 
a [josterity that make glorious the pages of 
American history. John Hathorn was the 
ancestor of the gentle and gifted Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, of the sixth generation, who in 
later years wrote of his two earlier ances- 
tors: "The present writer, as their representa- 
tive, hereby takes shame upon myself for 
their sakes, and pray that any curse incurred 
by them, as I have heard, and as the dreary 
and unprosperous condition of the race for 
many a long year back would argue to exist, 
may be now and henceforth removed." Cap- 
tain Daniel Hathorne, of the revolutionary 
army, and many, many others of note, also 
descend from John. He married, January 22, 
1674, Ruth, daughter of Lieutenant George 
Gardner. Children: John (2), born Janu- 
ary 10, 1675; Nathaniel, November 25, 1678; 
removed to Gosport, England; Ebenezer, see

The West family were of Eng- 
WEST lish origin and were early settlers 

in New England. They have 
been prominent and influential wherever 
foimd. 

( I ) Matthew West was of Lynn, Massa- 
chusetts, in 1636; freeman, 1637. In 1646 he 
was of Newport, Rhode Island, where he 
was made a freeman in 1655. He was a 
tailor by trade. There is no record 
of his marriage, and it is assumed by the 
Genealogist Austin in his "Genealogical Dic- 
tionary of Rhode Island" that his sons were 
Nathaniel, John, Robert, Bartholomew and 
Francis, who cannot be confounded with 
Francis of Duxbury, although the latter may 
have been related to the Rhode Island Wests. 
I. Nathaniel, died at Newport in 1659: he and 
wife were among the first twelve members of 
the First Baptist Church ; accidentally 
drowned. 2. John, of Newport ; made a free-

early and original purchaser of lands in Mon-

mouth with his brother Robert, and in the 
same year was elected deputy. He died prior 
to October 30, 1703, as is seen by a deed of 
that date from his son, John West, of Shrews- 
bury, New Jersey, wherein he reserves one- 
half acres of ground where his father is 
buried. He married Elizabeth, daughter of 
William and Audry Almy. Children: Bar- 
tholomew, William, John and Stephen. 

(HI) Stephen, son of Bartholomew and 
Elizabeth (Almy) W'est, was born in 1654. 
There is no record that shows whether he 
went to New Jersey with the family or not, 
but if he did he returned to Massachusetts 
and settled at Dartmouth, where his children 
were born. His wife's name is not recorded, 
but the births of nine children are as follows: 
Katherine, born September 9, 1684; Sarah, 
August I, 1686; Ann, July 9, 1688; Bartholo- 
mew, July 31, 1690; Amy, May 22, 1693; 
Stephen, May 19, 1695; John, April 27, 1697; 
Eunice, June 21, 1699; Lois, April 12, 1701. 

(IV) Stephen (2), son of Stephen (i) 
West, was born May 19. 1695, in Dartmouth, 
Massachusetts, died in that town between 
1768 and 1770. He was a man of consider- 
alDle means, as shown by proceedings attend- 
ing the settlement of his estate. His first 

wife was Susannah , as in 1729 and 

1730 Stephen and Susannah West conveyed 
lands. He married (second) Hopestill 

, who survived him, and made a quit 

claim of dower right October 15, 1778. 
Stephen had three sons and three daughters, 
mentioned in his will, which was made Janu- 
ary 3, 1768. Samuel, Stephen, Bartholomew, 
Anna, Susannah, Hannah. 

(V) Stephen (3), son of Stephen (2) and 
Susannah West, was born about 1730 in Dart- 
mouth, where he lived and probably died. 
He inherited property under his father's will, 
and in 1770 an indenture shows a division of 
Cedar Swamp property between him and his 
brothers, Bartholomew and Samuel. He was 
a private of Captain Robert Earl's company 
(Dartmouth), Colonel Josiah Whitney's regi- 
ment, in service from August 4, 1777, to Sep- 
tember 10, 1778; one month, seven days, at 
Rhode Island; also Captain Avery Parker's 
(first) company. Colonel John Hathaway 's, 
(second) Bristol company : entered service Au- 
gust 3, 1780, discharged August 8, 1780; ser- 
vice six days on an alarm at Rhode Island. 
(Massachusetts Soldiers and Sailors in the 
Revolution, vol. xvi, p. 901.) Stephen West 
married, and had issue, including a son, Jona- 
than, founder of the Saratoga county, New 
York, family. 

(VI) Jonathan, son of Stephen (3) West, 
was born about 1765 or 1770. He was the 



first of his family to settle in northern New 
York. He was living in New Bedford, Mas- 
sachusetts, and from there, in 1791, jour- 
neyed to Saratoga county with an ox-team, 
two cows, two sheep and such household 
goods as could be packed and transported in 
one wagon through an unbroken wilderness a 
good part of the way. He located in the town 
of Galway, purchased a tract of land, then 
in a wild state, that he converted into a fer- 
tile farm, and lived upon its proceeds until 
his death in 1857. He was twice married, 
his first wife, whom he married in Massachu- 
setts, succumbed to the pioneer privations 
after reaching New York. She bore him 
seven children. He married (second) Betsey 
Warren, in Galway, where she was born, lived 
and died. 

(\TI) Matthew, son of Jonathan West, 
was born in Galway, Saratoga county. New 
York, in 1816, died in 1881. He was a 
farmer and lived his entire life on the old 
West farm in Galway. He became an impor- 
tant man in the town ; was captain of militia 
and held many local political offices ; was a 
Democrat, ancl during the civil war was an 
intense Union man. He married, in Charles- 
town, Montgomery county, New York, Febru- 
ary 14, 1839, Elizabeth Doty, of Duanesburg, 
Schenectady county. New York, a descend- 
ant of Edward Doty, a "Mayflower" passen- 
ger (see Doty VII). Children: James Mar- 
vin, born March 12, 1840; William Henry, 
October 8, 1842, died July 5, 1861 ; George 
Nelson, October 17, 1849, <^I'ef' February 14, 
1854; George Herrick, see forward. 

(VIII) George Herrick, youngest son of 
Matthew and Elizabeth (Doty) West, was 
born in Galway, Saratoga county, New York, 
December 23, 1854. He was educated in the 
public schools of Galway, Troy Business Col- 
lege and the Union Classical Institute of 
Schenectady. He taught school for four years, 
then engaged in mercantile life in Galway 
until 1891. In 1897 he removed to Ballston 
Spa and engaged in a general insurance and 
real estate business, continuing until 1905, 
when he retired. Mr. West has had an impor- 
tant and interesting public career, beginning 
when a boy of nineteen years of age. In 
that year he began his fight agaist licensing 
the liquor traffic under the law of 1874, elect- 
ing commissioners of excise, and was one of 
the five organizers of the first temi)crance 
society of the town of Galway. In 1889 he 
was elected school commissioner of the first 
school district of Saratoga county, New ^■ork, 
which office he held for six years. In 1897 he 
was special agent for the forest, fish and game 
commission. In 1898-99 he was elected to 



!540 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



the New York assembly, serving with credit 
and force. In 1901 he was appointed clerk 
of Saratoga county by Governor Benjamin 
B. Odell, and by successive re-election still 
retains that office. He has made a faithful 
and efificient county clerk, and has the confi- 
dence of the people, and the commendation 
of those having business to transact with 
that office. Was chairman of Republican 
county committee from 1895 to' 1909. The 
Secret Law and Order League of the State 
of New York was founded and organized in 
1905 through his efforts, and he is now its 
president and superintendent, working with- 
out compensation. This organization was in- 
corporated in January, 1909, for the purpose 
of discouraging and suppressing Sunday 
desecration, distribution of obscene literature, 
the social evil, the white slave traffic, and to 
.•secure the enforcement of the laws against 
illegal liquor selling in license and no-license 
towns, gambling places and all dens of vice. 
The League has secured good results from 
tts efforts, and is continuing its work with 
vigor. In all reform movements, whether 
political or social, Mr. West has always taken 
an active part. He is a member of the Metho- 
dist Episcopal church, which he joined in 
1870. His fraternal orders are the Free and 
Accepted Masons, International Order of 
Good Templars and the Independent Order of 
Odd Fellows. He married, May 18, 1881, 
Carrie L., of Galway, New York, daughter 
of Peleg Burdick, of that town. 

(The Doty Line). 
Elizabeth Doty, mother of George H. West, 
was of the eighth generation of Dotys in 
America, she being the daughter of the sev- 
enth Doty in direct succession, beginning with 
Edward Doty, a passenger on the "May- 
flower," 1620, and signer of the compact. 
Governor William Bradford, in his "History 
of Plymouth Plantation," gives, in his list of 
"Passengers of the Mayflower," this item: 
"Mr. Stephen Hopkins and Elizabeth, his wife, 
and two children, called Giles and Constanta, 
a daughter both by a former wife, anil two 
more by this wife, called Damaris and 
Oceanus, the last born at sea, and two serv- 
ants called Edward Doty and Edward Lits- 
ter." Further on he .states: "Edward Doty 
and Edward Litster, the servants of Mr. Hop- 
kins, Litster, after he was at liberty, went to 
Virginia and ther dyed, but Edward Doty, 
by a second wife, hath seven children, and 
both he and they are living" (1650). Stephen 
Hopkins was a tanner, and the term "servant" 
probably means a workman, or in this case an 
apprentice. Edward Doty was invited to 



sign the compact, was treated as one of the 
company, and received the same allotment 
of land and stores as all other single men. 
This would indicate that he had reached his 
majority, though he probably owed some ser- 
vice to Stephen Hopkins. He is spoken of as 
a youth, and the presumption is that he had 
reached his twenty-first year. If this be true 
he was born about 1599. The name is spelled 
variously Doty, Doten, Dote and Dotez. 

(I) Edward Doty arrived in America on the 
"Alayflower," 1620. He was a wild youth 
apparently, and was a principal in the first 
duel fought in New England. He settled 
down and became one of the leading land 
owners and respected citizens. In 1672 he 
was one of the purchasers of Dartmouth, and 
owned much land elsewhere. He died at 
Plymouth, August 23, 1675. He married Faith 
Clarke, who survived him, born 1619, daugh- 
ter of Thurston and Faith Clarke. She was 
but sixteen years old when married, January 
6, 1635. They had ten children. 

(II) Joseph, youngest son of Edward and 
Faith (Clarke) Doty, was born at Plymouth, 
Massachusetts, April 30, 1651. He was a 
farmer and surveyor, and was one of the 
original purchasers and proprietors of Roches- 
ter, Massachusetts, where he was a man of 
importance. He was ensign, treasurer and 
large land owner. He married (first) Eliza- 
beth, born at Plymouth, September 5, 1654, 
daughter of Nathaniel and Sarah (Walker) 
Warren. She died about 1679, and he mar- 
ried (second) Deborah Hatch, born in Scitu- 
ate, Massachusetts, about 1662, daughter of 
Walter and Elizabeth (Holbrook) Hatch. 
She died at Rochester, Massachusetts, June 
21, 171 1, and he married (third), at Roches- 
ter, March 9, 1712, Sarah Edwards, who 
died about 1732-35. He had two children by 
first marriage, seven by second antl nine by 
third marriage. 

(III) John, son of Joseph and Deborah 
(Hatch) Doty, was born in Rochester, Massa- 
chusetts, March i, 1688. He left Rochester 
after his marriage and probably settled at 
Sharon, Connecticut, although there are no 
records to support the supposition. There is 
little record of him except land transfers 
in Rochester and Wareham, where he sold 
land in 1742-45. He married Elizabeth 

, and had two children, Samuel and 

Simeon. 

(IV) Samuel, .son of John and Elizabeth 
Doty, was born in Rochester, Massachusetts, 
about 1714. He was a mariner and was 
called "captain." He settled in Sharon, Con- 
necticut, where he was an active dealer in 
real estate and a surveyor. He later removed 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK \- ALLEYS 



to Amenia, Dutchess county, New York. He 
was a man of abilitj' and energy. He mar- 
ried (first), January 19, 1738-39, Zeruiah 
Lovell, who died December 11, 1760. She is 
buried at Sharon, Connecticut, where her 
tombstone says- "died aged forty-three years." 
He married (second), April 16, 1761, EHza- 
beth Southard. They had thirteen children, 
and he also had ten by his first marriage. 

(V) Asa, son of Samuel and Zeruiah 
(Lovell) Doty, was born at Wareham, Mas- 
sachusetts, November 6, 1746. He was fa- 
tally injured at Sharon, Connecticut, in 1788, 
by falling from a wagon. He was a soldier 
of the revolution, and in 1775 was an ensign 
in Albany county. He married Sarah Bar- 
num, in Sharon, Connecticut, who survived 
him and removed to southwestern New York 
with her daughter. They were the parents of 
seven children. 

[\l) Joshua Lovell, eldest son of Asa and 
Sarah (Ijarnum) Doty, was born in Sharon, 
Connecticut, 1769. He removed to Schenec- 
tady county. New York, where he died at 
Braman Corners in 1842. He married Mary 
Clayton, born in Connecticut, 1783. died in 
Schenectady county. New York, April i, 1868. 
They had six children. 

(VH) Elizabeth, daughter of Joshua Lov- 
ell and Mary (Clayton) Doty, born July 5, 
1822, died 1893, married Matthew West (see 
West VH). 

(Vni) George Herrick, son of Matthew 
and Elizabeth (Doty) West, married Carrie 
L. Burdick (see West XIU). 



The Finch family was founded

HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



Rogers and Pamelia (Shew) Finch, was born 
in Old Saratoga, New York, April 2, 1846. 
He was educated in the public schools at 
Perth and Fish House. When but a lad of 
fifteen years he enlisted November 3, 1861, in 
Company D, Seventy-seventh Regiment, New 
York State Volunteers, Bemis Heights' Bat- 
talion, and served with that regiment for 
three years. He was honorably discharged 
and returned home and spent that winter in 
school. In April, 1865, he re-enlisted in the 
Eighth Regiment Veteran Volunteers, known 
as Hancock's Corps, from which he was hon- 
orably discharged in 1866. During his first 
enlistment his regiment was attached to the 
Army of the Potomac and for three years 
his fortunes were those of that hard-fought, 
often-whipped, but finally victorious army. He 
participated in forty-three battles. On his six- 
teenth birthday he was under fire at York- 
town, \'irginia. A few days after passing 
his seventeenth birthday he was wounded dur- 
ing the second battle of Fredericksburg, after 
he fell, severely injured, the Union forces re- 
treated, pursued by the Confederates, both 
armies passing over him. The L^nion troops 
rallied, repulsed the rebels, drove them back 
and when his own regiment again reached him 
they discovered the lad bruised and wounded. 
He was taken from the field, sent to the hos- 
pital, and, recovering from his injuries, re- 
turned to his regiment. At the battle of the 
Wilderness he received his second wound ; his 
third was received in conflict near Washing- 
ton. During his second term of enlistment 
he was on garrison duty while the Union 
army was being mustered out and disbanded. 
During his first term of service he was pro- 
moted to the rank of sergeant, and was dis- 
charged the second time, ranking as corporal. 
After the war he came to Broadalbin, where 
he joined his father and remained at home 
five years engaged in farming. He next en- 
gaged in mercantile life, first as clerk, later 
as a member of the firm of W. W. Finch & 
Company, general merchants, continuing un- 
til 1883. in that year he took advantage of 
the homestead laws and, going west, took up 
a soldier's claim and returned to farming, 
continuing four years, after which he was 
engaged in mercantile business until 1895, 
when he sold out. and returned to his eastern 
home. He established in Broadalbin a coal 
and wood yard, where he also operates a steam 
mill, grinding flour, feed, etc. He has had 
an adventurous, prosperous life and still con-

(The Deyoe Line). 
Among the twelve original patentees of the 
town of New Paltz, Lllster county. New York, 
the last to cross the ocean from France was 
the Huguenot, Christian Deyoe. He was ac- 
companied by his son Pierre, the latter's wife, 
Agatha Nickol, and child, and the unmarried 
daughters. Maria, Elizabeth and Margaret, 
who later became the wives respectively of 
Abraham Hasbrouck, Simon Le Fevre and 
Abraham DuBois. The earliest records in the 
Dutch church at Kingston and the Huguenot 
church at New Paltz show different ways of 
spelling the name, Doyau, Doioie, Doyo and 
Deyoe, the latter now being the generally ac- 
cepted form. In the treaty with the Indians 
in 1677, Pierre (also a patentee) wrote the 
name "Doyo." His father. Christian, did not 
write his name but made his mark and the 
name is written "de Yoo." The Huguenots, 
of whom there were quite a number at Kings- 
ton and Hurley, were desirous of forming a 
settlement of their own where they might 
speak their own language, French, and form 
a community of their own. They finally pur- 
chased land from the Indians which included 
all the present town of Lloyd, about two- 
thirds of New Paltz, one-third of Esopus and 
one-fourth of Rosendale. In the records of 
the patentees, as the twelve signers were 
called, long preserved in an ancient trunk in 
the Huguenot Bank at New Paltz, is the copy 
of the document, signed by the Indians on 
their part, and by Louis Du Bois and his elev- 
en associates, one of whom was "Christian de 
Yoo his X mark," and his son, "Pierre Doyo." 
The bargain was approved by Governor An- 
dros, April 28, 1677. The patentees at once 
settled on their purchase at the point now 
known as New Paltz, all undoubtedly living 
on what is now Huguenot street, in that vil- 
lage. The records of the church from 1683 
to 1702 are written in I-'rench. and record 



many births, marriages and deaths of the De- 
yoes and others. The descent is through 
Pierre Deyoe, son of Christian, who died 
about ten years after the settlement at New 
Paltz and must have been a very old man. 
He made his will February i, 1686-87. There 
is a tradition that Pierre Deyoe, son of Chris- 
tian, died while on an expedition to find a 
route from New Paltz to the river, and that 
many years afterward a buckle from a truss 
he had worn was found among his bones. 
This Pierre was probably Pierre, a grandson 
of Christian and son of Pierre. 

(II) Pierre, .son of Christian Deyoe, came 
with his father to America bringing his wife, 
Agatha Nickol, and one child. He was one 
of the twelve patentees of New Paltz. He 
left four sons and two daughters. In 1675 
he was still in the Palatinate of Germany, as 
shown by his certificate of good standing, yet 
preserved in the family. "This is to cert'ify 
that Peter Doio and Agatha Nickol, both in 
honor living in Curr Pfalz, Mutterstadt, cir- 
cuit of Newstadt, have been united in mar- 
riage, the intent of such marriage having been 
announced three times from the pulpit, that 
they are members of the Reformed Church 
and as far as we know the same are well be- 
haved people. Mutterstadt. Curr Pfalz 21 
January, 1675. Jacob Amyot, Pastor." Chil- 
dren : I. Christian, of further mention. 2. 
Abraham, born at Hurley. New York, October 
16, 1676: married, 1702. Elsie Clearwater; 
he died in 1725, leaving a son Abraham, and 
daughters Marytje, and Wyntje. Abraham 
(2) was the father of Abraham Deyoe, of the 
revolutionary army. 3. Pierre, baptized at 
New Paltz, New York, 1683 ; grew to man's 
estate ; left no issue. 4. Hendricus, baptized

a gravestone believed to mark the burial place 
of Margaret, wife of Hendricus. Of the two 
daughters of Pierre Deyoe, Mary, the eldest, 
born 1679, married Jacob Clearwater, set- 
tled at Vontecoe, had son Abraham, baptized 
at New Paltz, 1699. Margaret, the second 
daughter, left no issue. 

(III) Christian, son of Pierre and Agatha 
(Nickol) Deyoe, was born in the Palatinate 
of Germany, 1674, and is the child alluded to 
as coming to America with his father and 
grandfather. Christian Dej'oe. He appears in 
the list of taxpayers in 1712; in the list of 
soldiers of Captain Hoffman's company, 1716,

records appears the following entry : "J'^"'"

The earliest record of Henrv 
WHITNEY Whitney, the American an- 
cestor of this branch of the 
Whitneys, is found October 8, 1649, when he 
was associated with two others in the pur- 
chase of land in Southold, Long Island. He 
was born in England in 1620, died in Nor- 
walk, Connecticut, 1673. He removed to Hunt- 
ington, Long Island, where he built a grist 
mill for Rev. William Leverich, about which 
there was some trouble resulting in law suits. 
He next removed to Jamaica, Long Island, 
where his name appears several times on the 
records — 1662-63-64. In 1665 he appears in 
Norwalk, Connecticut, where he built a 
"Grounde Corn Mill" at the mouth of "Nor- 
wake River by the falls." His last appear- 
ance on the records is October 11, 1669, in 
"A true and perfect list of all the freemen 
appertaining unto the plantation of Norwake." 
His will was dated June 5, 1672. An inven- 
tory was sworn to November 8, 1673. He 
was twice married, but nothing is known of 
his wives further than that his second wife 
was a Widow Ketcham.

founder," ("the only child mentioned in his 
father's will) was most likely born before his 
father went to Southold, Long Island, as he 
was of legal age prior to January 20, 1665-66. 



He settled with his father in Norwalk, fol- 
lowed the business of miller and millwright, 
succeeded him in the possession of the mill 
and homestead, later building a fulling mill 
at Norwalk, and seems to have been a busy, 
prosperous man. He married, March 17,

Smith. Children: i. John, born at Norwalk,

pation, business or trade. The Saxon word 
Chapman means a chapman, marketman, mer-

distinguished at an early period. The name 
occurs in several of the early settlements of 
New England, also in Maryland and Virginia. 
Fifteen of the name settled in these colonies

commissary of Fort Orange, a member of the 
governor's council; one of the justices of the 
peace for the county of Albany, and captain 
of the militia company. He was a wealthy and 
liberal man, and gave freely of his substance 
when the colony or his church was in need. 
In 1689 few subscribed a greater sum than he 
for the defence of the frontier, and no one 
paid a larger sum for the support of Godfrey 
Dallius, the minister of the Dutch Reformed 
church of Albany. He died in 1696, on his 
estate of several hundred acres, lying on the 
west side of the Hudson. It is a well founded 
tradition of the family that a party of Cana- 
dian Indians attacked his house with the in- 
tention of carrying him off a prisoner; he re- 
sisted the attack, and was killed in the affray.

the revolution he was an ardent Whig. As 
a member of the military committee of the 
Groote Inbogt district he kept close watch 
upon the Tories of the neighborhood and took 
his turn in patrolling the roads. In October, 
1777, he joined the yeomen who flocked to 
Green Point and Alaquaa's Hoek to oppose 
the Britisli in their progress up the Hudson. 
In 1781, at the age of thirty-two, he was a 
justice of the peace, an office at that time 
of considerable honor and usually conferred 
upon older men. He married (first) Engeltje 
Luke; (second) Elizabeth Van Vechten.

tion in private schools, and attended an acad- 
emy conducted by Rev. Dr. R. B. Fairbairn,, 
an Episcopal minister. Upon the completion 
of his schoohng he took up agricultural pur- 
suits on the farm which is now his home. 
He is a member of the Holland Society, also

Two members of the Lipe family

can colonies prior to the revolution, 
Johnannes (John), born 1764, settled on a 
farm in Montgomery county near Sprakers, 
During the revolution he owned the land on 
which the defences of Fort Plains were built. 
The property descended to his son David ; 
later to his grandson, Seeber Lipe. With the 
consent of the owner, the Montgomery county 
Historical Society erected small marble mon- 
uments in August, 1882, marking the site of 
the original fort erected 1776, and another 
the block house built in 1781. John engaged 
both in farming and in trade at Sand Hill, 
at that time in the town of Minden. He 
passed through the trying scenes of the rev- 
olution safely, although Minden suffered 
much from the Indians and Tories. After the 
war was over John married. November 11, 
1788, Elizabeth Lambert, and left numerous 
descendants. He continued in business until 
his death. 

The ancestor of Ephraim Lipe, of Cana- 
joharie, is also John Lipe, of the town of Root, 
Montgomery county. New York. He was a 
farmer and was killed by a running horse 
while attempting to cross the road. He lived 
in the troublous times of the revolution and 
served with the militia against the Indians.

rather a small way but the business soon took 
■on large porportions, and in 1883 he left the 



farm and located in the village of Sprakers 
and carried on business on a much larger 
scale. In February, 1889, he removed to the 
village of Canajoharie, which has since been 
his home. He remained in active business un- 
til 1909. when he retired. He became a very 
large dealer in hay and was well known 
throughout the valley where for forty-one 
years he bought hay from the farmers, doing 
business with some of them for nearly the 
entire period. About 1878 he admitted his eld- 
est son to a partnership, the firm name being 
E. & W. H. Lipe. He is held in the highest 
regard in the community where his entire life 
has been spent with the exception of seven 
years he spent in New York City taking 
charge of and marketing the hay shipments. 
During his residence in the town of Root he 
was much in the public service, serving as 
town collector of taxes and highway commis- 
sioner. In Canajoharie he has served as trus- 
tee and auditor of the village. He is a Re-

ner, was born in Ireland, 1828. He emigrated 
to the United States in 1849, coming on a 
slow sailing vessel. He settled in Amster- 
dam, where he became a well known and pros- 
perous mason and builder. He was also a 
builder of tan bark furnaces for the consump- 
tion of old tan bark. He met a tragic death, 
April 24, 1876. The spring freshets had car- 
ried away the bridge across the Mohawk river 
at Amsterdam ; late in the evening in com- 
pany with two attorneys of Amsterdam, John- 
son I. Snell and Cuthbert Patterson, he at- 
tempted to cross the river in a small boat, 
which on the way across overturned and all 
three were drowned. Mr. Turner's body was 
found eleven months after on Scotia Flats, 
Schenectady. The tragic death of these three 
well-known men caused universal sadness 
in their city. He was a man of thrift 
and energy, highly respected. He mar- 
ried, in Amsterdam, Bridget McCormick, 
born in county Meade, Ireland, emigrating to 
the United States about the same time as 
her husband. They settled on a farm in the 
town of Day, Saratoga county, where she died

Bridget (McCormick) Turner, was born in 
Day, Saratoga county. New York, November

and contracting trade with his father, work- 
ing in connection with him until the death of 
the latter in 1876, when he succeeded him, 
took the business in charge and has since 
successfully conducted extensive building 
operations all over the section known as East- 
ern New York. He was for a time, 1890-97, 
in partnership, but since the latter date has 
carried on the business alone. He is one of 
the best-known contractors of his own city 
and has erected many large and costly build- 
ings in neighboring and distant cities. For 
years he has erected many of the buildings of 
the General Electric Company of Schenectady 
the largest being eight hundred fifty-two by 
one hundred fifty-three feet in size. Among 
public buildings may be noted : the Elk Club 
House, and St. Mary's Parochial School, re- 
cently completed. Much of his success in his 
building operations he ascribes to the com- 
petent co-operation of the architect, C. M. 
Underwood. Politically Mr. Turner is a Dem- 
ocrat. He is a member of the Amsterdam 
board of trade, and since 1903 has been a

Tliis particular branch of the 
PHILLIPS niillips family has been 
seated in the Mohawk valley 
for more than a century. They descend from 
the New England family of Phillips, whose 
ancestors date back to an early period in tlie 
bistory oi that section. The history of the 



Schenectady branch begins with George Phil- 
lips, of Montgomery county. New York, •^vho 
was born at Fort Plain about 1800. and died 
near that village aged sixty-five years. He 
married Miss Adams, who survived him, but a 
short time. He was a farmer and a Demo- 
crat. Children: i. Robert, of further men- 
tion. 2. Winchell, lived and died at Little 
Falls, New York ; married Sarah Marsh, who 
survives him, a resident of Little Falls. 3. 
Julia, married Gottlieb Ludwig; children: 
Harry and Harriet. 4. Matilda, married, but 
left no issue. 5. Sarah Jane, unmarried, the 
only surviving child. 

(II) Robert, eldest son of George Phillips, 
was born in Fort Plain, New York, June 27, 
1823, died in 1885. He received a good edu- 
cation in the public schools and for several 
years was a teacher and instructor. He later 
engaged in mercantile life and was a merchant 
of Fort Plain. Later he engaged in the lum- 
ber business and removed to Bridgeville. He 
was a Democrat until the outbreak of the civil 
war, when feeling that his party was not liv- 
ing up to the promises of its platform, he 
voted the Republican ticket. He married, in 
Fort Plain, Sarah, born June 8, 1828, daughter 
of Jonas and Wyncha A. (Low) Myer. \\'yn- 
cha Low was of the Low family of Saugerties, 
Ulster county, New York, and was related to 
ex-Mayor Seth Low, of New York City. The 
Myer family were early settlers of Ulster 
county ; Jonas died in Saugerties at the age 
of fifty-six. and Wyncha, his wife, at the age 
of sixty. Of their family, two daughters, An- 
gelina and Sarah, arc the only survivors 
(1910). Robert and Sarah Phillips were 
formerly Presbyterians, but later connected 
with the Congregational church. They were 
brought into the latter communion through 
the preaching and teaching of Henry Ward 
Beecher, the eminent divine of Brooklyn, New 
York. Children: i. Eugene Wilson, born 
August 29, 1849, now a merchant of Sauger- 
ties, New York; married IMartha J. Decker, 
and has a daughter Ella, married Edward 
Morgan. 2. George Wellington, of further

gerties, New York, with her son Eugene W. 
Phillips. She is now (November 2~, 1910) 
eighty-two years of age, yet so well preserved 
in mind that she has contributed many of the 
dates and facts contained herein, but says she 
"is weak and feeble and cannot write as I 
once could." 

(HI) George Wellington, second son of 
Robert and Sarah (Myer) Phillips, was born 
in Saugerties, Ulster county, New York, Oc- 
tober 16, 1852, In 1865 his parents removed 
to Bridgeville, Delaware, where he completed 
his studies. His father was engaged in the 
lumber business until his death, at the age of 
sixty-two years. He worked with his father 
at lumbering, and later became his traveling 
salesman. An important feature of their busi- 
ness was the burning of charcoal, and George 
W. traveled among the leading users of char- 
coal, disposing of large quantities of their prod- 
uct. After the death of Robert Phillips, his 
wife and family returned to Saugerties. While 
in Delaware, George W. had become greatly 
interested in the fruit and nursery farms of 
that section, and after his return to New York 
started a nursery in Saugerties, which he con- 
tinued until 1897. Finding soil and climate 
not well suited to this enterprise, in Septem- 
ber of that year he removed to Schenectady, 
New York, where he established the coal bus- 
iness, which he has since successfully oper- 
ated. He has taken more than passing interest 
in local afifairs, and when civic conditions were 
not satisfactory, organized and was secretary 
of the Taxpayer's Association, that brought 
about some needed reforms. He is a member 
of the Albany Street Methodist Episcopal 
Church, and a Republican in politics. He mar- 
ried, in Saugerties, Josephine Trought, born 
near New Brunswick, New Jersey, September 
24, 1857, and came to Saugerties, New York, 
with her parents in 1865. She is a daughter 
of Robert, son of John Trought. Robert 
Trought enlisted in 1861 in Company S, 30th 
New Jersey Volunteers, recruited from New 
Brunswick, and served until the close of the 
war. He was a good soldier and made an 
honorable war record. He was a member 
of the Methodist Episcopal church. His 
daughter, Mrs. Josephine Phillips, is a mem- 
ber of the Dutch Reformed Church of Sche- 
nectady. Children of George W. and Jose- 
phine (Trought) Phillips: i. George H., 
born October 10, 1874; educated in Sauger- 
ties ; now a photographer with a studio in 
New York City ; he married Effie Bailey, of 
Glens Falls, New York. 2. Robert, died in 
1876, aged ten months. 3. Lillian, born 1877, 
died aged twenty months. 4. Bertha M., born 
October 29, 1879, married Lawrence Kemp- 



ton, manager of the Phillips Coal Company. 
5. Maude, born June 16, 1884; married Wil- 
liam H. Pier, of Schenectady. 6. Mabel, born 
October 6, 18^8, died aged seven vears. 



The many forms of spelling 
PHILLIP this name is confusing when an 

attempt is made to trace from 
the present to past generations. It is supposed 
that Philip, Phillip, Phillips, Philips, Phillipse 
and Philipps are families all owning a com- 
mon ancestor. The name Phillips is derived 
from the Greek and signifies "horse lover.'' Its 
use as a surname has continued in Wales and 
other parts of Great Britain for at least five 
centuries, perhaps longer. There are many 
branches of the family in the LInited States 
dating from 1630 at Watertown, Massachu- 
setts. "A Phillips crossed the water with John 
Winthrop and from him descended a long line 
of ministers, judges, governors and council- 
lors, — a sturdy race, temperate, just, and high- 
minded." From the address of Dr. Porter 
at the centennial celebration of the Claverack 
Church we find that the ancestor of the Phil- 
lip family in Columbia county was an early 
settler of Germantown. He had six sons, four 
of whom removed to Claverack : George, Wil- 
liam, Henry and David. Two sons remained 
in Germantown. Germantown was settled by 
the Palatines but not exclusively. In a list 
of heads of families reported as willing to re- 
main in Germantown, August 26, 1724, is the 
name of Hans Peter Phillip. He may be the 
ancestor referred to by Qj^rPorter. The vil- 
lage of Philmont, in the town of Claverack, 
is named in honor of George P. Phillip, who 
was the first to manufacture there on an im- 
portant scale. A branch of the Philip family 
settled in Mellenville, where George Philip 
and Stephen Miller were among the first to 
engage in trade. They were succeeded by 
their sons and afterwards by William Phillip, 
who was long in trade there. Captain George 
Phillip kept one of the first public houses there, 
which other members of the family continued. 
The branch of the family that settled in Ghent, 
Columbia county, were among the most num- 
erous in that town, where one of the name still 
owns the old homestead. Mellenville was or- 
iginally known as "Hard Scrabble," and the 
Phillip family were among the first settlers. 
George Phillip was a blacksmith. He served 
in the revolution and gained the title and rank 
of captain. 

(I) William Phillip was long in trade in 
Mellenville, (Hard.scrabble). He married Re- 
becca Ostrander, who bore him David, Aaron, 
(see forward) ; John, Gertrude, Catherine and 
Elizabeth Ann.

(H) Aaron, second son of William and 
Rebecca (Ostrander) Phillip, was born in 
Claverack, Columbia county, New York in 
1819, and died in Mellenville, January 26, 
1905. He was quite young when his parents 
removed to Mellenville, where he obtained his 
education. His parents were religious people 
and trained the boy to read and study the 
Scriptures, which in later life gained him a 
reputation as a Bible scholar. He learned the 
carpenter's trade, worked for several years as 
a journeyman, later became a contractor, and 
in Claverack and Mellenville erected many 
buildings and dwellings. He was a most tire- 
less worker in the Dutch Reformed church at 
Mellenville, and was an elder and superintend- 
ent of the Sunday school for many years. 
He was charitable, generous and ever thought- 
ful of others. He married Ann Fowler of 
Mellenville. who survived him four years, dy- 
ing in August, 1909. . Children : Oscar W. ; 
Harriet Elizabeth: Rebecca (see forward); 
James E. ; Sarah E., married Frank Horton ; 
John H., married and has Fred W. and Cath- 
erine ; Emma, married Jacob Fassett ; Mary 
Augusta ; David Franklin ; Gertrude. 

(HI) Rebecca, third child of Aaron and 
Ann (Fowler) Phillip, was born in Mellen- 
ville, Columbia county, New York, where she 
received her education. After leaving school 
she removed to Troy, New York, where she 
entered the factory of William A. Harden; she 
was capable and ambitious, soon rising to the 
position of forewoman, becoming a trusted and 
valuable employee. She was generously re- 
membered in ^Ir. Harden's will. 



The first Burdick of record in 
BURDICK America, and the ancestor of 

the Burdicks of Galway, Sara- 
toga county, New York, is Robert Burdick, of 
Westerly, Rhode Island, who died in 1692. He 
was a farmer of Newport, Rhode Island, 1655, 
and was of Westerly, November i, 1661. He 
was a seceder from the Baptist church, join- 
ing with the Seventh Day Baptists. He was 
in the thick of the fight with Massachusetts 
over jurisdiction, and was arrested with To- 
bias Sanders and others, brought before Gov- 
ernor John Endicott. charged with "forcible 
entry and intrusion" into the bounds of Sou- 
thertown in the Pequot country. He admit- 
ted he was upon the lands mentioned and had 
built a small house there. He and Sanders 
were committed to prison, both refusing to 
give bail for their appearance at general court, 
denying that Massachusetts had any juris- 
diction over them or the territory in which the 
house was built. They were committed to the 
Boston jail and kept there two years, finally 



being exchanged for two Massachusetts offi- 
cials taken in retaliation by the Rhode Island 
authorities. May 8, 1669, he was on a list 
of the inhabitants of Westerly. May 17, 1671,. 
he took the oath of allegiance. July, 1675, 
he and his family went to Newport on account 
of the Indian war, but later returned to \\'est- 
erly. May 17, i(3gi, he and wife Ruth sold 
one hundred acres of land for ten pounds. 
March 8, 1692. he made an agreement with 
his son-in-law, Joseph Crandall, by which the 
latter was to take care of his father-in-law and 
"find him with suitable meat, drink, washings 
lodging and apparel, etc., for life, in consid- 
eration of which Joseph Crandall was to have 
the dwelling house and land adjoining for- 
ever." He died October 25, 1692. He mar- 
ried, November 2, 1655, Ruth Hubbard, who 
was the first white child born in Springfield, 
Massachusetts, January 11, 1640, died 1691, 
daughter of Samuel and Tacy (Cooper) Hub- 
bard. Children: i. Robert, married Dorcas 
Lewis. 2. Hubbard, died 1758; married Han- 
nah Maxon, died 1752; children: Hubbard

Joseph Crandall, died September 12, 1737; 
children : John, Joseph, and a daughter. From 
this sturdy, conscience-guided ancestor, Rob- 
ert, sprang all the Burdicks who claim an 
early Rhode Island ancestry. The history of 
the Saratoga county family herein recorded 
begins with Daniel, a descendant of Robert 
Burdick, of Westerly. 

(\T) Daniel Burdick was born in Rhode 
Island, and settled in Saratoga county. New

of others and courteous to an opponent. He 
was a well-beloved pastor and dear to the 
hearts of his parishioners. He was honored

The Kenyon family is of rec- 
KENYON ord in Rhode Island as early 
as 1687, when John Kenyon's 
name appears on the tax list of Kingstown. 
The family was numerous in the state of 
Rhode Island, and marriage of the sons and 
daughters of the various branches are of fre- 
quent note in the records. 

John Kenyon, born 1657, died 1732, was 
the son of John, the emigrant, of whom noth- 
ing can be told. John (2) married and had 
a son John (3), born January, 1682, mar- 
ried July, 1704, Elizabeth Remington. 

(V) William Kenyon, born about 1755, 
was of the fifth generation including the emi- 
grant. Who he was the son of does not ap- 
pear in the records. He was evidently a 
grandson of John (3) and Elizabeth (Rem- 
ington) Kenyon, of Kingstown, Rhode Isl- 
and. He married Nancy Greene, born August 
17, 1761, died 1824, (laughter of Amos and 
Amy (Knowles) Greene. They lived in Rich- 



mond. Amos Greene was a great-grandson' 
of John Greene, the emigrant ancestor of 
North Kingstown, Rhode Island, 1639. Chil- 
dren of William and Nancy (Greene) Ken- 
yon : Sally, William, Catherine, Jeremiah and 
Joseph. 

(VI) William (2), son of William (i) and 
Nancy (Greene) Kenyon, was born about the 
year 1785. He removed from Rhode Island 
and settled in what is now the town of Lu- 
zerne, Warren county. New York, then 
Washington county. He was a farmer and 
operated a small saw mill, most likely using 
the logs cut from his own lands. He married 
and had issue. 

(VII) Hiram, son of William (2) Kenyon,. 
was born in Luzerne, Warren county. New 
York, February 10, 181 1, died 1884. He grew 
to manhood in his native town, and was edu- 
cated in the public schools. He early became 
engaged in the lumber business, leaving home 
at the age of twenty years, paying his father 
one hundred dollars to release him from the 
remaining year of his minority. He first lo- 
cated in the town of Moreau, where he owned 
and operated a saw mill located just across the 
Hudson river opposite Sandy Hill. The man- 
ufactured lumber from his mill was floated 
across the river to the Glens Falls feeder of 
the Champlain canal, where it was carried 
away by boat to distant points. In 1846 he 
removed his plant, and residence to Sandy 
Hill, which was his home ever afterward. He 
was a successful business man and conducted 
operations that brought added prosperity to 
his village. His lumber yards and mills at 
Sandy Hill were extensive and up to the year 
of his retirement (1872) he was the most im- 
portant lumber merchant of the town. He 
dealt largely in timber lands as well as in 
manufacturing, and owned large tracts in 
Northern New York. He was a faithful mem- 
ber of the Presbyterian church of Sandy 
Hill, and was a Democrat in politics. 
He served as supervisor for two or 
three terms, but he was primarily a 
business man, public office having no 
attractions for him. He was well regarded 
in his community and his genial nature 
brought him a host of friends. He married 
Hannah .\. Griffin, bom in Queensbury, War- 
ren county. New York, January 3, 1813, died 
at Sandy Hill, January 6, 1900, daughter of 
Jonathan Griffin, born in Rhode Island, moved 
to the town of Queensbury at an early day 
and engaged in farming and milling of lum- 
ber. She was a devoted member of the Pres- 
byterian church until death. Qiildren: Syl-

Of the parentage, birthplace, 
BROWN and early history of Chad 

Brown nothing definite seems 
to he now known. Accompanied by his wife, 
Elizabeth, and son John, then eight years old, 
and perhaps his younger sons, he emigrated 
from England in the ship "Martin," which ar- 
rived in Boston, Massachusetts, July, 1638.

soon removed to Providence, Rhode Island, 
where he at once became a leader in the col-

Descendants of Chad Brown have been con- 
spicuous in early and subsequent Rhode Isl- 
and history. They have served the colony and 
state in every public capacity including the

the family generosity. John and Moses- 
Brown had much to do in founding the free 
school system in Providence. They were suc- 
cessful business men in each generation and 
equally prominent in the chuifh and the pro- 
fessions. Far beyond the confines of Rhode 
Island they have scattered and made honored 
names. The Browns of Coxsackie descend' 
through Daniel Brown.

has no children. 



(The Buckbec Line). 

This family settled first in Westchester and' 
Dutchess counties, New York. Their origin 
is difficult to determine as the name is evi- 
dently a corrupted form of another surname. 
The Bockee family of Dutchess county have 
as branches claiming common origin, Buckey, 
Bocke, Bowker, Bockes and Barikes. The 
surname Buckbee may come from a descend- 
ant of Matthias Buquet. The first of mention 
in Dutchess county annals is Israel Buckbee, 
of Stanford, horn about 1740, died 1820. Ten 
of the name Buckbee served in the revolution 
from New York state, but the family identi- 
fication is impossible. Israel had sons.

The Dubois families of Ulster 
DL' BOIS and other Hudson river coun- 
ties in New York state are the 
descendants of Louis and Jacques Du Bois, 
Walloons and Huguenots. Louis was born 
October, 1626, in the province of Artois in 
Wicre, a hamlet about twenty miles south- 
west of the ancient city of Lille ; son of Chris- 
tian Du Bois. Little is known of his early 
life ; he was possessed of some education and 
w-as reared a Protestant. While young he re- 
moved to Manheim in the Palatinate of Ger- 
many. October 10, 1655, he married Cather- 
ine Blanjean (or Blanshan), daughter of a 
burgher of that ancient city. They had two 
■children born in Germany. In 1660 with his 
wife and two children he came to New Neth- 
■erland. He first settled at Esopus near or in 
what is now the village of Hurley, where he 
engaged in trade. In the Indian war of 1663 
when Esopus was destroyed, his wife and 
three children were carried oflf by the sav- 
ages, but were subsequently recaptured by a 
pursuing party, including Louis Du Bois. In 
1677 he with eleven other Huguenots and 
Frenchmen, like him.self, obtained from Gov- 
ernor Andros a patent for a large tract of 
land which now- lies in the Valley of the Wal- 
kill in the town of New Paltz ; removed there 
with the other patentees, and began the life 
of a pioneer. A church was founded and un- 
til 1689 Louis remained in New Paltz, re- 
■.moving in that year to Kingston, New York, 



where he died about 1695. He left a nu- 
merous progeny and descendants yet own and 
till the soil, first brought under cultivation by 
their sturdy faithful Huguenot ancestor. Chil- 
dren : I. Abraham, bom in Manheim, Ger- 
many, was one of the twelve patentees of New 
Paltz and the last survivor, dying October 7, 
1731, aged about seventy-four years; he mar- 
ried Margaret Deyo. 2. Isaac,' born in Man- 
heim, Germany, was one of the patentees of 
New Paltz, where he died June 28, 1690, aged 
thirty-one years; married Marie Hasbrouck. 
3. Jacob, the first child of American birth, 
born in Kingston, October, 1661 ; he settled 
upon one of his father's farms at Hurley; 
married Gerilje Gerritsen, daughter of Ger- 
rit Cornelissen, son of Cornelius Van Nieuw- 
kirk. 4. Sara, married Joosl Jansen. 5. Da- 
vid, married Cornelia Varnoye. 6. Solomon, 
married Trintjn Gerritsen, sister of Jacob's 
wife. He was a very large land owner in 
Ulster and Greene counties, New York, and 
in Pennsylvania ; one tract of three thousand 
acres in the Walkill Valley he gave to his 
son Cornelius (subject to certain payments) ; 
he was also an official of the French church 
at New Paltz and held many public trusts. 
7. Rebecca, born 1671, died young. 8. Rachel, 
born 1675, died young. 9. Louis, born 1677, 
married, 1701, Rachel Hasbrouck. 10. Mat- 
thew, born 1679 ; married Sarah Mattheyson ; 
he inherited half of his father's Hurley farm 
and his house and lot in Kingston where he 
was living in 1706. 

Jacques Du Bois, a near relative and per- 
haps a brother of Louis Du Bois. born in 
the same neighborhood as Louis, came to Eso- 
pus fifteen years later than his kinsman. The 
letter of church membership from the Wal- 
loon church at Leyden, Holland, which he 
took with him when leaving that city, is dated 
April 15, 1675, as is evidenced by the church 
records still extant. He must have died after 
his arrival as his widow, Pieronne Bentyn, 
married (second) prior to December, 1677. 
On leaving Leyden in 1675 Jacques had put 
on record a power of attorney to sell his house 
in that city which would indicate that he had 
been a resident there some time. He is de- 
scribed in the Leyden records as a manufac- 
turer of gros-grains, coarse grained fabrics of 
cloth and silk. He left three sons of tender 
years: Jacques horn in Leyden where he was 
baptized in the Protestant church of the Wal- 
loons, by the name of Jacobus, in March, 1665 ; 
John, baptized July, I'i7i : Pierre (known 
as Pieter), born at Leyden, March 17, 1674. 
being but three years of age when his mother 
again married. Jacques also left daughters, 
Maries, Jean and .Anne. Louis and Jacques

owned land and built a stone house on the 
banks of "Mender's Kill" before 1725. This 
land was known as the Matthias Houghtaling 
patent. Through subsequent purchases by 
sons of Richard, the family became the own- 
ers of a large tract of land west of the upper 
village of Coxsackie. Robert, son of Rich- 
ard J., built a sawmill on a small stream which 
flows into the west branch of Potick creek,

lings and other consideration did convey to 
Hendrick and Robert Van Denburg "All that 
southermost half of the whole tract XX\' con- 
taining eighteen hundred forty-three acres 
XXXX and one-half of all mines which may 
be found hereafter on the above lands." This 
tract of land thus set oflf to the brothers be- 
came popularly known as the "Van Denburg 
Patent" though it was not an original patent 
grant. Later it was divided into lots and De- 
cember 21, 1745, Hendrick Van Denburg con- 
veyed to Richard, Wilhelmus and John \'an 
Denburg seventeen of the lots each contain- 
ing it was supposed fifty acres, but of one of 
them the story is told that by some reason it 
contained sixty acres. This caused later legal 
proceedings which gave it the name of 
"Chancery lot," Hendrick resided in the stone 
house, north of the creek, which he built. He

The founder of the Bogar- 
ROGARDUS dus family in America was 

the famous Dominie Ever- 
ardus Bogardus, pastor, counsellor and friend 
of the early Dutch settlers of New Amster- 
dam, who cheered them amid their toils and 
adversities and in dark hours of peril ; joined 
many of them in marriage : baptized their chil- 
dren ; oft performed in their stricken homes 
the last sad rites and frequently acted as guar- 
dian of their estates. He was the first settled 
minister of the Dutch church at New Am- 
sterdam, where he continued until his last trip 
to Holland in 1647. He sailed from New 
Amsterdam in the ship "Princess" in company 
with Director Kieft, August 16, 1647. O" 
September 27, having mistaken their course, 
they were wrecked upon a rock on tlie coast 
of Wales. Dominie Bogardus and Director 
Kieft both perished, although many were 
saved. (For an extended account of his ca- 
reer see Bogardus in Gray family history.) 
He was a valuable man in the settlement, his 
advice was constantly sought in matters af- 
fecting both individuals and the community 
and the amount of public business with which 
he was intrusted on his final departure for 
Holland evinced the continued respect and con- 
fidence of his people. He married, June 21, 
1642, Anneke (.Annetje) Jans, or Jansen, who 
had a grant of sixty-two acres between the 
present Warren and Christopher streets, New 
York City. This land has probably caused 
more bitter controversy than any other on 
earth. It forms the basis of dispute between 
the heirs of Aimeke and Dominie Bogardus 
on the one hand and Trinity church corpora- 
tion on the other. Its immense value makes 
the ownership a prize worth striving for and 
fierce legal battles have been fought over it. 
The title, however, seems to rest with Trinity 
corporation. After the death of Dominie Bo- 
gardus, his widow took up her residence in 
Albany, continuing there until her death in 
1663. Children: \\'illiam, in 1656 a clerk in 
the secretary's office in New Amsterdam and 
in 1687 postmaster of the province; Cornelis, 
baptized September 9, 1640. in New ^'ork 
Citv, later of Albanv, married Helena Teller :

The founder of the Bronck family in 
Anierica was Jonas Bronck. born in Copen- 
hagen, Denmark, died at Bronxland, West- 
chester county. New York. He married An- 
tonia Slagboom. He came to America in 
1639 from Amsterdam where he had married. 
He came in his own ship "Fire of Troy," a 
private armed vessel manned by himself, ac- 
companied by his friend and officer in the 
Danish army. Captain Jochiem Pietersen Kuy- 
ter. He brought a cargo of cattle and each 
was attended by his family and a number of 
farmers or herdsmen. He was a man of 
means, and loaned money in large sums to 
his friends. He was of a family long dis- 
tinguished in Sweden, though probably him- 
self from Copenhagen. He located his land 
north of the Great Kill and built a "stone 
house covered with tiles, a barn, tobacco house, 
two barracks, etc." He later purchased from 
the Indians five hundred acres on the now 
Bronx river, later included in the Manor of 
Morrisania. He had cattle, servants, landed 
possessions, a substantial home, and his vrouw 
pronounced "a good housekeeper." He was a 
devoted Lutheran, and brought with him Luth- 
er's Catechism and a folio Danish Bible. From 
it he drew a name for his home "Emaus." 
It was here that Director Kieft send dele- 



gates to meet the Indian chiefs and made a 
treaty. This treaty was followed by the un- 
proved murder of the Indians for which they 
exacted frightful vengeance upon the Dutch 
settlers. It was at this time that Jonas Bronck 
met his death, perhaps at the hands of the 
savages, but as his property was spared, they 
may have been guiltless. "Seignor" Bronck, 
as he was styled, must be rated above the or-* 
dinary colonist. His Danish and Latin libra- 
ry', stored with law, history, and books of di- 
vinity, indicate taste, culture and piety. His

The DuBois and Overbagh families of Cat- 
skill are intimately connected with the early 
history of the village and town. The farm 
of Johann Jury Overbagh was in the form 
of an oblong, and near the center he built a 
stone house twenty feet square. During the 
revolution the cottage was a place of muster 
for the minute-iiierisof the district and a ref- 
uge for their fiiirrilies when it was rumored 
that the Mohawks were about. The tomb- 
stone of John Pieter Overbagh, a narrow 
slab of gray flagstone, bears the inscription 
"1734, September 14, J.P.O.B." It is the old- 
est tombstone in Catskill. (The DuBois fam- 
ily is further considered in this work.)

It has been transmitted from 
FANNING one generation to another 
that in the Fanning family 
their ancestor, Edmund Fanning, escaped 
from Dublin in 1641, at the time of the great 
rebellion, and after eleven years of wandering 
and uncertainty he found a resting place in 
that part of New London, Connecticut, now 
called Groton, in the year 1652. On the town 
records his name is not mentioned until ten 
years later, but it is then in such a way that 
denotes previous residence. In the inventory 
of goods of Richard Poole, April 25, 1682, 
one article is "two cows and one steere now 
with Edmon ffanning." After this he had a 
grant of land and is propounded to be made 
a freeman in Stonington. His estate was dis- 
tributed to his widow and four .sons, Ed- 
mund, John, Thomas and William. A de- 
scendant, Captain Edmund Fanning, of Ston- 
ington, Connecticut, in 1797-98-99 made a 
voyage for seals in the ship "Betsey." He 
discovered several islands near the Equator 
not before laid down on any chart. They 
are known as Fannings Islands. Nathaniel 
Fanning, a brother of the discoverer, was an 
officer in the ship commanded by Paul Jones 
in his famous naval battles and by his gallant.

He died in Charleston, South Carolina, Sep- 
tember 30, 1805.

his brethren of the profession is inserted in

ciety was called upon to mourn the death of 
Dr. Nelson Fanning, Senior, of Catskill, New 
York, whose death at an advanced age re- 
moves from this Society its oldest practition- 
er ; from his many patients a warm friend and 
physician ; from the county a reputable and 
upright citizen, and from his family a kind 
and most indulgent father. His burial was 
marked by a large attendance of his friends 
and patients' who thus offered a last tribute 
of res]iect to the memory of a friend and of 
sympathy with the family in their bereave- 
ment.

The ancestors of the Salis- 
SALISBURY bury family of Catskill, 

New York, is Silvester 
Salisbury, born in England or Wales about 
the year 1629. That he was a kinsman of the 
ancient family of Salisbury in Denbigshire, 
Wales, is proven by his coat-of-arms, which 
he brought with him from the mother coun- 
try, and which is now in the possession of his 
descendants in Catskill. This coat-of-arms is 
carved in hard wood, and except that the 
demi lion in the crest does not hold a crescent 
or, in its paws is identical with the coat-of- 
arms of the Welsh Salisburys. Two swords 
or rapiers also brought by Silvester Salisbury 
are preserved in the family, one stamped 1544 
and in a hollow near the hilt is the word 
"Sachgum." The other sword bears the date 
1616. Another heirloom is the portrait of 
Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII ; 
said to have been painted by Holbein. That 
he was well educated is shown by his letters. 
In 1664 Silvester Salisbury, being an ensign 
in the English army, took part in the con- 
quest of the New Netherland. In 1670 he 
was sent either as lieutenant or captain to 
take command of Fort Albany, and was al- 
most immediately appointed schout fiscal of 
Rensselaerwyck. The next year he aided in 
making a treay of peace between the Mo- 
hawks and the Indians of New England. Soon 
afterward he was appointed one of the jus- 
tices of the peace of Albany. In 1673 he was 
forced to surrender his post to the Dutch, who 
sent him a prisoner to Spain, at that time an 
ally of the United Provinces. During the 
next year he was released ; returned to New 
York, and placed in command of his old post. 
In 1675 he was sent to England as bearer of 
dispatches to the king. He was probably 
chosen for this mission on account of his 
gentle birth. He was most graciously re- 



ceived by the Duke of York, to whom he had 
been commended by Sjr Edmond Andros. He 
returned to New York in the spring bearing- 
letters from the duke to the governor of the 
province. In one of the letters the duke 
wrote, "I send you this by the hand of Cap- 
tain Salisbury; of him I have a good char- 
acter and therefore would have you remember 
him, upon any fit occasion for his advantage 
in my service." Since 1677 he in company 
with Marte Gerritse Van Bergen becaine the 
purchaser of an immense estate at Catskill, 
included within the boundary of the "Cats- 
kill Patent." But before a patent was ob- 
tained for their purchase Silvester Salisbury 
died. The date is unknown, but it was be- 
tween August 26, 1679, the date of his will, 
and March 24, 1680, the day on which his 
widow was confirmed as executrix of his will. 
He married, in 1669, Elizabeth, daughter of 
Peter Cornelise Beck, a master carpenter

1679. He became of age in 1700, but did not 
enter into possession of his father's estate in 
Catskill for several years thereafter, as it 
passed through a long and severe legislation 
before its boundary was finally settled by the 
court of error. While still a lordly domain, 
much of it was lost by the line being estab- 
lished by circular instead of straight lines of 
a specified distance. In the division between 
the Sali.sbury and the Van Bergen families, 
Francis took the northern portion of the low- 
lands, which included the plain on the Katts- 
kill between the highway from Leeds to 
Kaaterskill and Wolcotts Mills. It contained 
forty thousand acres in what is now the town 
of Leeds. Prior to coming into his inherit- 
ance, Francis lived at Albany and Kingston. 
In the autumn of 1699 he enlisted as a pri- 
vate soldier for the defence of the frontier 
against a threatened invasion by the French. 
In 1703 he removed to Catskill and was ap- 
pointed supervisor of the district between the 
Inbogt and the northern bounds of Cox- 
sackie. Two years later he built the Salis- 
burv mansion on the northeastern side of the

(The Hand Line). 

The Hands originally came from England, 
settling at Lynn, Massachusetts. The tradi- 
tion is that the emigrant ancestor returned to 
England to obtain his share of some property 
which he inherited in common with others, 
and on his return voyage was murdered. He 
left two sons, of whom John of Easthampton 
is the progenitor of the family here recorded. 
The English arms of the family are: "Argent, 
a chevron azure between three hands, gules. 
Crest : on a wreath argent and gules a buck 
trippant or."

village was on the east side of Church street, 
next door to the Dutch church. He also had 
farm land on the Third Flat on the south 
side of the Mohawk, eight miles above Sche- 
nectady. The house on the farm, known as 
the "Old Mebie House," was built or at least 
its stone walls date from 1670-80, and is 
doubtless the oldest house in the Mohawk 
A'alley. In 1697 Rode, a Mohawk Sachem,

The Odell family, so long occu- 
ODELL pying a prominent place in the 
county of Westchester. New 
York, descend from William Odell, who was 
of Concord. Massachusetts, 1639. He came 
to New England with the Rev. Peter Bulkley, 
who was rector of the parish of Odell in Bed- 
fordshire, England, 1620. William Odell' 
died at Fairfield, Connecticut, June. 1676, 
and from his sons John and William the West- 
chester family spring. The family have been' 
eminent in war, politics and business.

ther of William Odell, owned a large estate- 
in the town of Greenburg, Westchester coun- 
ty, and lived in the old Stone Inn, still stand- 
ing on the roadside at Albottsford just below

was erected by Captain John Harmse prob- 
ably as early as 1693. It is noted as having 
been the building in which a session of the 
provincial assembly was held August 31, 
1776. Jonathan Odell served in Colonel Sam- 
uel Drake's regiment, Westchester county 
militia, as did many of his sons and nephews.

He was lield a prisoner in the old Sugar 
House Prison at New York City for a time 
and suffered much loss of property from the 
depredations of the British General Vaugh 
and his troops. Jackson Odell, also a soldier 
of the revolution, was probably a brother of 
Jonathan. The line of descent is thus traced.

setts.

educated in the schools of Peekskill. He was 
reared to habits of industry, and at the age of 



eleven years was self-supporting. These hab- 
its of industry and thrift contributed in a 
large measure to his success in after life. He 
was not contented with a farmer's life, and 
leaving home began teaming and trucking. 
In this manner he secured a foothold in the 
business world, and made many friends who 
were disposed to help a young man of such 
energy as he displayed. In 1876 he sold his 
teaming outfit and came to Albany. Here he 
secured an appointment as special deputy 
sheriff and held that office eleven years. He 
saw an opportunity to increase his capital and 
purchased a small restaurant, which he oper- 
ated for six years, when he disposed of it at 
a good profit. His next venture was in a 
large restaurant at Troy, New York, which 
he did not long operate, selling out and re- 
turning to Albany where he purchased the 
Globe Hotel Restaurant. Here he success- 
fully continued the catering business for ten 
years, then retired after eighteen years spent 
as a caterer. During these years he had pros- 
pered and he invested his profits in real e,s- 
■ tate, to the management of which he now de- 
votes his entire attention. He owns several 
apartment houses and other business renting 
dwellings in Albany and has other business in- 
terests. He is a member of the Masonic or- 
der, belonging to Lodge, Chapter, Temple and 
Consistory, being a thirty-second degree Ma- 
son. Politically he is a Republican. He mar- 
ried (first) in Peekskill, Theodosia Hadden,

ner) Coleman, of old English families. She

earnest member of the First Methodist Epis- 
copal Church of Albany, as is her husband.

1842. died October 3, 1905. He was educated 
in the public schools and at Knox Academy. 
He grew up on the farm, and at an early age 
became his father's trusted assistant, both in 
farm management and in the store, thus ac- 
quiring a thorough business education that 
stood him well in the heavy responsibilities of 
his later life. Years before his father's death 
Edward L. had assumed full control of both

quently a delegate to county and state con- 
ventions, where he was counted among those 
whose opinion was of weight. During the 
administration of President Harrison he was 
postmaster at Knox, where in private or pub- 
lic life he was the soul of honor and held the 
confidence of his townsmen in a degree sel- 
dom equaled. He was a warm-hearted, gen- 
erous man and a friend of education, the 
church, and all good causes, supporting liber- 
ally the institutions that depended on the pub- 
lic for their existence. He was a member of 
the Masonic order and of the Lutheran

This is an ancient family of 
LITHGOW Scotland, famed for its schol- 
ar artists, men of letters and 
ministers. A noted member of the family, 
William Lithgow, born in Lanark about 1582, 
eldest son of James Lithgow, burgess of Lan- 
ark, and Alison Gahame his wife, published in 
1632 a collected edition of his travels under 
the title of "The Totall Discourse of the Rare 
Adventures and painefull Peregrinations, of 
long nineteen yeares Travayles, from Scotland 
to the most Famous Kingdomes in Europe, 
Asia and Aflfrica." He was educated at Lan- 
ark grammar school and acording to .Sir Wal- 



ter Scott was "bred a tailor." He seems to 
have started his travels at an early age. He 
says "neither ambition, too much curiosity, nor 
any reputation I ever sought, did expose me to 
such long peregrinations «nnd dangerous ad- 
ventures past" — but, that "underserved Dalida 
wrong." From Paris on March 7, 1609, he 
set out on the first of the three journeys of 
which he gives an account in his "Totall Dis- 
course," where he claims that his "payneful 
feet traced over (besides my passages of seas 
and rivers) thirty-six thousand and oddc 
miles, which draweth neare to twice the cir- 
cumference of the whole earth." It was on 
the second of his journeys, while passing 
through Spain, that he was thrown into pris- 
on in Malaga as a spy and severely tortured. 
He was released by the intervention of the 
English consul there and the English ambas- 
sador at Madrid backed by a division of King 
James navy. On his arrival at Datford, fifty 
days after leaving Malaga, Lithgow was car- 
ried to the court at Theobalds and exhibited 
his "martyred anatomy" to the whole court, 
"Even from the King to the Kitchen." Al 
the king's expense he was sent twice to Bath, 
where he recovered his health although his 
left arm and crushed bones were incurable. 
Early in 1622 he was sent to Marshalsea pris- 
on for a long period for assaulting in the 
presence chamber Gondomar, the Spanish am- 
bassador, whose empty promises of redress for 
his sufferings at Malaga had exasperated Lith- 
gow beyond endurance. In 1624 he preferred 
a bill of grievance to the House of Lords, 
which he daily followed for seventeen weeks, 
witlutut result. In 1627 he left the court for 
Scotland, traversed the Western Isles and 
was "kindly cntertayned" in Bodick Castle by 
James "Marquiss of Hamilton." In 1637 he 
left Scotland mounted on a "galloweigan 
nagge" for another journey to Russia, but in- 
stead went to Breda publishing a volume on 
his return. In 1643 he again left Scotland, 
embarking at Prestonpans for London. "In 
all which deserted way between Forth and 
Gravesend wee found only three ships, two 
Scotsmen, an Norwegian, and one of the 
royall whelps lying at anker in .•\ermouth." 
He published his tast work in 1643. From 
this date all trace of him is lost; the date of 
his death and the place of his burial are un- 
known, though there is a tradition that he 
died in Lanark and lies buried in the church- 
yard of St. Kentigern there. It is from the 
same Lithgow family that David C. Lithgow, 
of .Mbany, descends.

gow, was born in Glasgow, Scotland, Novem- 
ber 12, 1868. His preparatory education was 
obtained in the Glasgow public schools sup- 
plemented by a course at Glasgow Technical 
College. Having artistic talent and desire he 
became a pupil at the Haldean Academy of 
Art, at Glasgow, where he pursued his studies 
until 1887, when he went to London and en- 
rolled as a student at Kensington School of 
Art under Sir Frederick Leighton. After 
completing his studies he came to the United 
States in 1888, establishing himself in New 
York City, where he remained until i8go. In 
that year he came to Albany where he opened 
a studio and still continues (191 1) in land- 
scape and portraiture. He is a member of the 
Albany Club and a charter member of the 
Albany Art League. In religious faith he is 
a Baptist. He married, February 10, i8go, at 
Altamont, New York, Amelia, daughter of 
Edward and Augusta (Crounse) Kenholts, 
both old Albany county families. Child, Mil- 
lie, born November 4, 1900. 



Three generations of the Geiger 
GEIGER family are herein recorded, each 
generation claiming a different 
country as a birthplace. George Geiger, 
grandfather of Albert Geiger, of Hudson, was 
a native of Poland, and fled an exile from his 
native land, taking refuge in Germany. He 
was a man of ability, and is supposed to have 
become implicated in some revolutionary 
movement that placed him under the ban of 
the government. He settled in the province 
of Wiirtemburg, Germany, where he lived and 
reared his family. He was twice married and 
one of his sons, John, was a noted sculptor of 
Munich, giving promise of becoming famous 
in his art, when he was stricken by death at 
the earlv age of twenty-five vears. The only 



record of others of his family is of Leonard, 
founder of the American branch. 

(II) Leonard, son of George Geiger, the 
Polish exile, was born in Wiirtemburg, 
Germany, October 23, 1829. He remained 
there until 1849 when, to avoid military serv- 
ice, he came to the United States. He was 
educated in the German schools, secured a 
good education and developed a strong genius 
for invention. He learned the trade of stone 
and marble cutting, but on his arrival in New 
York worked for a time for the Hudson 
River railroad. He did not long remain in 
that employ, but soon settled in Hudson, New 
York, where he followed his trade. In 1858 
he formed a partnership with James N. Town- 
send and until 1870 operated a stone and mar- 
ble yard, doing principally monumental work. 
In the year mentioned the partnership was 
dissolved and he continued the business alone 
for a year or two, then sold out to his former 
partner and retired from that line of business, 
devoting himself to his inventions. These in- 
cluded many articles of value which should 
have netted him a large fortune! but through 
the chicanery of those whom he trusted, he 
received only a small return for the product 
of genius. Two of his inventions were of the 
greatest value in military warfare and were 
universally adopted. His greatest, perhaps, 
was the breech-loading ritle which he brought 
out in 1864. While he was well-paid for his 
invention, the amount was but a trifle com- 
pared with the value of the invention. Those 
promoting the gun received large suins. An- 
other invention was a copper- jacketed bullet, 
which is yet in use in several of the armies 
of the world. While his pay for this was to 
have been $30,000, he really received but a 
small sum. being swindled out of his right. 
Mr. Geiger was a Republican in politics, but 
extremely independent. He joined with the 
Liberal movement of 1872, and supported 
Horace Greeley for the presidency. After the 
overwhelming defeat of his favorite he took 
little interest in political affairs. Aside frorn 
one term as alderman of Hudson, he held no 
public office. He was reared in the Catholic 
faith, but after coming to the United States 
attended the Episcopal church, later be- 
coming a follower of Robert Ingersoll. He 
was a member of the Masonic order, charter 
member of Aquilla Lodge of Hudson, also a 
Chapter Mason and a Knight Templar. He 
married, February 14, 1852, Margaret Fire- 
wig at Hudson, New York, who survives him, 
residing in Hudson. She was born in Nurem- 
berg, Germany, and came to the L'nited States 
in 1850. Children: i. Frederick, a resident 
of Hudson. 2. .\lliert, of further mciition. 3.

a seaman on several whaling trips. 



The Van Slykes of Cox- 
VAN SLYKE sackie. New York, de- 
scend from Willem Pie- 
terse Van Slyke, who was in Beverwyck in 
1655. He had sons: Pieter, Jacob, Dirck and 
Teunis. There were Van Slykes, early set- 
tlers in Beverwyck ; Cornelius, whose descend- 
ants settled in the Mohawk Valley, and Wil- 
lem, whose descendants settled below Albany 
in Columbia county, then crossed over into 
Greene county where they held large posses- 
sions. 

(H) Teunise Willemse. son of Willem Pie- 
terse \'an Slyke, was born at Heyvelt, prov- 
ince of L'trecht, Holland. Fie was of Bever- 
wyck in 1666, when he sent to Holland for 
his inheritance. Fie was the founder of the 
\'an Slykes, who settled on the west bank of 
the Hudson, now Greene county. New York. 



In 1678 he purchased and occupied a farm at 
Niskayuna, Schenectady county, New York. 
In 1713 he built the stone house on the west 
bank of the Hudson, one mile south of where 
the village of New Baltimore now stands. In 
1733 'le was one of the four church officers 
who received the deed for the land upon 
which to build the Dutch Reformed church at 
Coxsackie. The Boston Morning Journal of 
January 12, 1903, described the Bible once 
owned by Teunise Willemse \'an Slyke as 
the oldest printed Bible on earth, made in. 
Dordrecht, 1518-55, now owned by Benjamin 
Fredenberg Van Slyke, of Saginaw, Michi- 
gan, handed down from father to son, about 
four hundred years, and containing the fam- 
ily record. The paper devoted a column and 
a half to the description of this Bible, which 
was seventeen inches long, eleven inches 
wide and five and three-quarter inches thick. 
The workmanship on the same was equal to 
that of the present time; the binding was of 
calf, and the illustrations (which were beau- 
tiful), as well as each initial letter, was all' 
hand work, there being no modern machin- 
ery (such as used to-day) at that early period. 
It was claimed that the Massachusetts His- 
torical Society offered $10,000 for the book; 
that an attemjjt was made to secure it for the 
World's I-'air at Paris: that it took thirt_v- 
seven years to make the book, made by Rich- 
ard Paul Eelbo. It was taken from New 
Baltimore to Michigan in 1858 by Benjamin's 
father, Peter J., son of General Pieter \"an 
Slyke, a general in the revolution, son of 
Gerrit, son of Teunise Willemse \'an Slyke. 
Teunise Willemse Van Slyke's wish was to be 
buried in sight of the passing vessels on the 
Hudson, and his grave on a knoll in the- 
woods south of his house is yet to be found. 
The Van Slyke coat-of-arms comes down 
from the fourteenth century. A clover leaf 
on one side of a battlement, three fish natant 
on the other side. He married, February 6, 
i6g6, Jannetje, daughter of Flenrick \'an Wie, 
a volunteer in the colonial war, in Rensselaer-

sterdam in 1639, purchased land now known 
as "The I'ronx," upjjer New York City. His 
son, Pieter Bronck, of Beverwyck, purchased 
Coxsackie of the Indians. He had a fine col- 
lection of books brought from Holland when 
he came in his own ship with family, servants 
and wealth, and these books arc said to be the 
first library of mention in New York State. 
He met his death, it is sujiposed, at the hands 



of the Indians, although his property was un- 
disturbed, which may prove that he came to 
his death in a less horrible manner than by 
the tortures said to have been inflicted upon 
him ere death mercifully released him. The 
belief is that he came to America from Den- 
mark via Amsterdam. Rev. Everardus Bo- 
gardus, the first settled minister of New Neth- 
erland, assisted in the administration of his 
estate (See Bronk, in this work). The Bronck 
family had a coat-of-arms, as displayed on a 
silver cup brought by Jonas Bronck — a shield 
bearing a rising sun, rayed, with the motto: 
A't- cede mails (Yield not to evil). 

The descent from Jonas Bronck to Judith 
(Bronk) Van Slyke is through his son, Pieter, 
who married Hilletje Tyssinck. Jan Bronk, 
son of Pieter, born 1652, married Commetje 
Conyn, and served in the wars. She was 
daughter of Leendert Philipse Conyn, in Bev- 
erwyck, 1655, married Agnetje . Peter 

Bronk, son of Jan, married, in Albany, Antje 
(Anna) Bogardus, born January 22,- 1679, 
daughter of Pieter Bogardus, born April 19, 
1644, and granddaughter of Rev. Everardus 
Bogardus, the first settled minister of New 
Netherland (See Bogardus genealogy). Peter 
Bronk, son of Peter, born November 10, 1707, 
married Rachel \'an Hoesen, a descendant of 
Jan Franse Van Hoesen, who bought Clave- 
rack. New York, from the Indians in 1662. 
Ephraim Bronk, born March i, 1755, served 
in Coxsackie company. Eleventh Regiment, 
Albany county militia, was at the surrender of 
Burgoyne ; married Annetje Knott, lx>rn 1756 
in New York City, daughter of James Knott, 
buried in Trinity churchyard, and his wife, 
Nancy Dunbar. Judith Bronk, born March 
13, 1788, married Teunis B. Van Slyke. A 
descendant of Jonas Bronck, Amelia Cornelia 
Bronk, widow of Andrew Whitbeck, of Coey- 
mans, and likewise a great-granddaughter of 
Hendrickse Van Wie, died in Coxsackie, aged 
one hundred and three years. Children of 
Teunis B. and Judith Van Slyke: i. Hannah 
Jane, born August 7, 181 3, married Benoni 
Clapper. 2. Ephraim T., of further mention.

The JNIac Cabes were one of 
McCABE Ireland's most powerful clans. 
Originally coming from county 
Cavan, they spread over Cavan and the neigh- 
boring counties, dominating wherever the 
branches of the family settled. They were 
descended from Colla da Chrioch, founder of 
the Kingdom of Origiale, the first king of 
which was a Mac Cabe. His descendants 
continued to rule over that kingdom, and were 
also styled Kings of Ulster down to the time 
of the subjugation of that province by the 
English in the twelfth century. The Mac 
Cabes were men of great strength and valor, 
and in the old days gave many famous com- 
manders and galloglasses to Ulster. With 
the decline of Irish influence in Ulster the 
hand of adversity fell hard upon the Mac 
Cabe clan. The clansmen, although subju- 
gated, were never conquered. The spirit of 
the old chieftains was inherited by their de- 
scendants, and the Mac Cabes, broken in for- 
tune but not in. spirit, kept up an almost con- 
tinuous warfare against the conquerors. In 
the course of the centuries, however, the Mac 
Cabe clansmen became scattered over the 
widely distant parts of the world, carrying 
in their hearts, however, a wildly passionate 
devotion to Hibernia, and as passionate a 
hatred of her conquerors. They also carried 
with them the same rugged strength and cour- 
age which characterized them in the early his- 
tory of Ulster. 

In the days of their supremacy in Ireland 
they had allied themselves with the O'Reillys 
anci the O'Neils, who with the Mac Cabes 
were the three most powerful families in 
county Cavan. Their influence was para- 
mount in every branch of county aiTairs, mili- 
tary and civil, and they also contributed many 
powerful prelates to the Irish church of that 
period. 

(I) Descended from a long line of those 
pure Celtic ancestors was James McCabe, who 
emigrated with his family to America in 1844, 
and settled in Albany, New York. 

(II) John, son of James McCabe, married, 
in Albany, Anne, daughter of Patrick and 
Mary (Daley) Cassidy, both of whom were 
natives of Dunganna, county Tyrone, Ireland, 
and who had come to the United States in 
1828, and after a three months' voyage across 
the ocean settled in Albany, where March 9, 
1833, their daughter Anne was born. Anne 
survived her husband and is still living in Al- 
bany, being now in her seventy-eighth year. 
She is a fine type of Irish-American woman- 
hood, and now in the winter of her life may 
well look back with pride upon a life full of 
good works. The writer, an old friend, re- 



members her as always a sweet, charitable 
and neighborly woman, deeply religious, and 
an earnest and constant advocate of total ab- 
stinence, in a field in which she accomplished' 
immeasurable good. Her life's story, far- 
reaching and womanly as it has been, is an 
inspiration to all who know her. Children : 
I. James, born 1857, died 1898, married Mary 
J. Holton, also deceased, leaving one child, a. 
son, John J., who is unmarried and resides in 
Albany. 2. Patrick Edgar. 3. John P., born 
1 86 1, married Catherine Reagan, and still re- 
sides in Albany. 4. Mary T., born 1863, died 
1885, unmarried. The sons were all educated' 
in the Christian Brothers' Academy, at Al- 
bany, New York, and have all manifested con- 
siderable activity in political affairs, Patrick 
E. being especially prominent. 

(Ill) Patrick Edgar, second son of John' 
and Anne (Cassidy) McCabe, was born in' 
Albany, New York, June 26, 1859. Upon 
leaving school he learned the trade of moul- 
der, moulding being at the time about the 
most remunerative trade open to a young 
man. Dissatisfied with the limited opportuni- 
ties whic-h his trade seemed to hold out tO' 
him, he took the United States civil service' 
examination and in 1885 was appointed to a 
clerkship in the Albany, New York, post of- 
fice. Here his early education and great nat- 
ural ability soon asserted themselves, and, to- 
gether with his constant activity in politics, 
caused him to be appointed assistant county 
treasurer, an ofiice which he filled with signal' 
ability. He occupied this position for six 
years, and at the end of that time had become 
one of the recognized leaders of the Demo- 
cratic party in the county of Albany. In 
1 80S he was elected clerk of the county of 
Albany, and in the year 1900 was chosen as 
the representative of AHjaiw county on the 
Democratic state committee, a position which 
he still holds. He has since become one of 
the recognized leaders of the Democratic- 
party in the Empire State, and is always a 
familiar figure in state and national conven- 
tions. He has proven himself an able and 
resourceful leader and counsellor, and has 
often exhibited qualities of rare courage and 
strategic genius in the face of odds which 
would be the undoing of a less able man. On 
January 4, 191 1, Mr. McCabe was elected 
clerk of the senate of the state of New York, 
a position the importance of which can hardly 
be over-estimated. His conduct of this office- 
has met the unquahfied approval of all stu- 
dents of public affairs. He is a Roman Cath- 
olic and a member of the congregation of the 
Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. A\- 
banv. In 1898 he married Elizabeth T. Kielev,.

the National Bank of Coxsackie, having 
served in that capacity for many years. He is 
prominent and active in public affairs, and 
for many years has been president of the vil- 
lage corporation. He is prominent in the

(The Woodell Line). 
Sarah (Woodell) Parker is a descendant 
of William Wodcll, of Boston, Massachu- 
setts, and Portsmouth. Rhode Island, who died 
in 1693. He was of Boston, 1637, and evi- 
dently embraced the religious views of Rev. 
Wheelwright and Ann Hutchinson, for on 
November 20, 1637. he was ordered with 
otliers to give up all guns, pistols, swords, 
powder, shot, etc., because "the opinions and 
revelations of William Wheelwright and Mrs. 
Hutchinson have seduced and led into dan- 
gerous errors many of the people here in New 
England." January 12, 1643, he and ten 
others bought of Aliantonomi for "144 fath- 
oms of Wampum" a tract of land called by 
tlie Indians Shawomet (Warwick). Here 
began his trouble with Massachusetts Bay 
Colony, who claimed jurisdiction and title to 
Rhode Island. September 12. 1643, '^^ with 
others of Warwick was notified to appear 
at general court at Boston to hear complaint 
of two Indian sachems, Pomham and Socon- 
occo, as to "some unjust and injurious deal- 
ings toward them by yourselves." The War- 
wick men declined to obey the summons, de- 
claring they were legal subjects of the King 
of England, and beyond the limits of Massa- 
chusetts territory, to whom they would ac- 
knowledge no subjection. Soldiers were sent, 
who besieged the settlers in a fortified house. 
In a parley it was said "they held blasphemous 
errors" which they must repent of "or go to 
Boston for trial." November 3, 1643, having 
been brought with others before the court at 
Boston charged with heresy and sedition, they 
were sentenced to be confined during "the 
pleasure of the court," and should they break 
jail or preach their heresies or speak against 
the church or state, on conviction their sen- 
tence would be death. Extreme as such meas- 
ures now seem, they are matched by the un- 
daunted courage of the men who in the face 
of such danger held to their religious convic- 
tions and defied their enemies. William Wo- 
dell was sent to Watertown, but not to prison, 
and remained at large until the following 
March and was then banished from both Mas- 



sachusetts and Warwick. He thereupon re- 
turned to Portsmouth. Most of his compan- 
ions in the trial suflfered close imprisonment 
for several months. In 1655 he was made a 
freeman; 1656-63 was commissioner; 1664- 
1686 was sixteen times elected deputy to the 
Rhode Island general court. April 4,' 1676. it 
was voted "that in these troublous times and 
straits in this Colony, this Assembly desiring 
to have the advice and concurrence of the 
most judicious inhabitants of it may be had 
for the good of the whole, desire at their next 
meeting the company and counsel of Mr. Ben- 
edict .Arnold," and fifteen others among whoni 
was William Wodell. May 5, 1680, he was- 
appointed as a committee to "put the laws and 
acts of the colony into such a method that 
they may be put in print." In 1684 he was 
elected assistant (to the governor), but posi- 
tively refused to serve. His will was proved 
May 2, 1693. An extract throws some light 
upon the charges made by the sachems for 
which he was first "haled to Boston," ".And 
whereas it hath been said by several persons 
that I with some others did go about to wrong 
the town of Portsmouth in purchasing Hog 
Island of an Indian sachem called Mossosup, 
I am so far from doing any wrong therein 
that I do give unto the free inhabitants of the 
said town of Portsmouth * * '' Hog Island 
and other land." He makes the same state- 
ment in regard to some land bought on Rhode 
Island. 

He married Mary , and had a son 

Gershom, born July 14, 1642, who married 
Alary Tripp and had sons. William Wodell 
also had daughters Mary, Sarah, Alice and 
Frances, who married and had large families. 



The .Vmerican progenitor of 
C.ARHART the Carhart family, Thomas 

Carhart, arrived at New 
York, August 25, 1683, holding the appoint- 
ment of private secretary to Colonel Thomas 
Dongan, English governor of the colonies in 
.'\merica at that date. He was the son of 
Anthony Carhart, of Cornwall, England, and 
was born about 1650. "The bible of .'\nthony 
Carhart — more than two hundred years old — 
containing the name of Tliomas Carhart is 
still in existence in England." "The earliest 
mention of the family in the Herald's office 
and British Museum. London, is 1420, where 
the name is found to liave been Carharta and 
Carhurta. .Arms ; ar. two bars sa. in chief, a

Descendants of Thomas Carhart are found all 

•over the United States. In Westchester 

•county, New York, the name is found as Car- 
hartt, Carehartt and Carhart. The first rec- 
ord found in America referring to Thomas 

•Carhart is of a joint petition with William 
Britton for lands on the south side of Staten 
Island at a place called Great Hill, dated May, 
1691. In that year he was clerk of Richmond 
county (Staten Island), New York. Novem- 
ber 22, 1691, "a marriage license was granted

wife, to John Loofburrow of Woodbridge, for 

■ one acre of upland on the south side of Crane 
Creek, to frame and erect a grist mill, with 
right of way through the lands of Thomas 
Carhart." This shows that Thomas and Mary 
had removed to W'oodbridge, New Jersey, 
prior to 1695. His will proved April 6, 1696,

This is one of the oldest 
MYNDERSE families of the Mohawk 

Valley ; has been prominent 
in Schenectady from the earliest period of its 
history, and descendants two and a half cen- 
turies later are found occupying high positions 
of trust and honor. These descendants are 
to be found not only bearing the name of 
Mynderse, but also that of Van Inveren. the 
name of the town in Holland from which 
the immigrant ancestor came. As will be 
seen in the following record the intermar- 
riages of the heads of each generation con- 
nect the present with the principal early 
settlers of Schenectady and the Dutch pio- 
neers of .\lbany. Maria Wcmp ( Wemple) 
was a daughter of Jah Wemp and a grand- 
daughter of Jan Barentse Wemp, who came 
to Beverwyck in 1643 O"" "'HS- Married 
Maritje Myndertse, who after his death mar- 
ried Sueer Teunise Van Velsen, "the village 
miller,"' both of whom perished in the Indian 
massacre of February 9, 1690. Sarah Swart 
was a (laughter of Esaias and Eva Jan Scho- 
enderwocrt (alias Van Woert^ and grand- 
daughter of Teunis Cornelise Swart, one of 
the original proprietors of Schenectady, who 
married Elizabeth \'andcr Linde. Geerdriy 
Van Slyck was a granddaughter of the first 
settler of the name in Beverwyck. and An- 
netje A'edder was of the fourth generation 
from Herman Vcdder, the "founder;" Other 
prominent and familiar names will be noted 
in the record.

erickse, came to Beverwyck from Holland and 
were among the early settlers. They were 
smiths and followed their trade there. Among 
their landed estate was the property now the 
corner of Broadway and Spanish (now Hud- 
son) street, Albany. They were members of 
the Lutheran church, of which Myndert was 
an elder and Carsten deacon in 1680. The 
latter died about 1690, leaving four children. 
Myndert Frederick se was armorer to the fort 
in 1697. He made his will, March 21, 1703- 
04, proved May i, 1706, in which he speaks 
of "My house hard by the church on Cow 
Street" (now Broadway) and of "my church 
book with silver clasp and chain." He mar- 
ried (first) Cathalyn Burchard (Burger) in 
New Amsterdam, August 5, 1656; (second) 
Retertje Teunise Van Vechten, in 1663. At 
the date of his will he had five living children : 
Frederick, born in 1657; Burger, 1660: Neelt- 
je, married Hendrick Douw ; Reinier and Jo- 
hannes, who settled in Schenectady. 

(H) Johannes Myndertse or Mynderse, son 
of Myndert h'rederickse, of Albany, settled in 
Schenectady in 1700. By trade he was a 
blacksmith and armorer to the fort. Like 
most of the other residents of the village, he 
was an Indian trader. In 1723 he was ar- 
rested by the sheriff of Albany county and 
brought before the Albany common coun- 
cil for having, contrary to the ordinances of 
the city of Albany, "received into and har- 
bored in his house Indians with beaver and 
other peltry." This was a serious charge, as 
the Albany traders claimed exclusive privi- 
leges with the Indians. He was fined ten 
pounds, which he refused to pay, whereupon 
the sheriff was ordered to keep "said Myn- 
derse safely in the common jail." But he 
shortly escaped, and as a punishment for his 
negligence the sheriff was ordered to pay 
Mynderse's fine and cost. Mynderse appealed 
his case to the supreme court of the province, 
sitting in New York City, and gained his 
case; he received from the common council 
damages which with fees and costs amounted 
to forty-one pounds nine shillings and three 
pence. It is believed the decision effectually 
established the rights of citizens of Sche- 
nectady to the same privileges of trade 
as the citizens of Albany. Johannes Myn- 
derse made his will, May 4. 1754, proved 
September 7, 1757, wherein he speaks of his 
three sons, Myndert, Jacobus and Reynier, 
and distributed his estate between them. He 
then owned property on the west corner of 
Mill lane and State street, also on the north 
side of State street, where he had a black- 
smith sliop and a bolting house. He married 
Gcertruy, daughter of Jacques Cornelise Van 



Slyck, and granddaughter of Cornelise, the 
first settler of the family in Beverwyck. Chil- 
dren : I. Myndert, see forward, f 2. Margaret,

April 22, 1709, in Albany. 4. Reynier, Octo- 
ber, 1710. 5. Petries, April 19, 1718. 

(III) Myndert, son of Johannes and Geer- 
truy (Van Slyck) Mynderse, learned and 
followed his father's and grandfather's trade 
of blacksmith. He inherited under his father's 
will lot No. 93 State street, Schenectady, and 
the blacksmith shop next east of it. He made 
his will in 1761, proved July 18, 1763, and 
speaks of wife Maria, sons Johannes, Barent 
and Harmen, and daughters Geertruy, Mar- 
gareta and Sarah. To Johannes he gave his 
house and blacksmith shop. He married, Jan- 
uary 15, 1736, Maria, daughter of Jan and 
Sara (Swart) Wemp (Wemple). Children: 
I. Geertruy, baptized July 11, 1736; married

(IV) Colonel Johannes (John) Mynderse, 
son of Myndert and Maria (Wemp) Myn- 
derse, was baptized October 18, 1741. died 
October 29. 1815. He was also a blacksmith, 
judging from the fact that to him his father 
left by will his blacksmith shop and tools. 
Many of this generation are borne upon the 
revolutionary rolls of New York state as sol- 
diers both in the line and in the Albany county 
regiments. John Mynderse was captain of 
the Second Regiment, Albany county militia, 
commanded by Colonel Abraham Wemple. 
He was colonel of militia after the revolu- 
tion and a man of pfominence. He married 
Annetje, daughter of Simon and Maria

HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



James Cowee was born in the 
COWEE old world in 1726 or 1727 of 

unknown parentage. He died 
April 29, 1801. He was the ancestor of those 
distinguished by that name in this vicinity, if 
not in the entire country. While yet a lad, 
as the story goes, his mother died. A step- 
mother coming into the family did not take 
kindly to him or his brother Bartholomew, 
but neglected and abused them. The father, 
as they grew older, conceived the idea of 
sending them to America to seek their for- 
tunes and work out their destinies. He made 
an arrangement with the captain of a vessel 
about to sail thither, a warm personal friend 
of his, to take the youths with him, paying 
him liberally for their passage and entrusting 
him with additional funds to be given them 
when they should disembark, as a means of 
getting a'start in the new land. During the 
voyage Bartholomew, the younger brother, 
died, which was a sad misfortune to the sur- 
vivor. The captain of the ship proved recreant 
to his trust, betraying the confidetice of his 
friend and cheating an innocent, destitute and 
needy young man, a stranger in a strange 
-land, out of his rightful due. He not only 
'withheld from the lad what he had received 
from the father for the sons' special use to 
be paid upon landing here, but actually sold 
him into temporary service, as the custom 
sometimes was in those days, for the second 
payment of the passage money across the sea. 
After the term of servitude he worked his way 
tback into the country among the new settle- 
ments, tarrying here and there as he could 
find employment, at length reaching Chocksett 
(now Sterling), where he remained a while, 
but ere long he came to Narragansett No. 2, 
where October i, 1750, he bought of Rev. 
Elisha Marsh lot number 96. He at once be- 
gan improvements, cleared six acres, erected 
a good cellar house, set out an orchard and 
had things well under way before the follow- 
ing July. He was an industrious, skillful, 
prosperous farmer, a man of much independ- 
ence and force of character, becoming one of 
the largest land holders of the town and hav- 
ing one of the most valuable residences at 
the time of the levying of the general United 
States tax in 1798.

The maternal line of the McKie 
McKlE family of Cambridge, New York, 

traces to Phineas Whiteside, born 
June 31, 1716, in county Tyrone, Ireland, died 
in the town of Cambridge, Washington county. 
New York, 1793. He came to the Ameri- 
can colonies about the year 1736 with his 
brother, landing at Philadelphia, and making 
settlement in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania. 
He was a man of education and maintained 
a iirivate school, which he taught until he 
moved from the state. He was Protestant 
in religion and probably a Covenanter, if the 



fact that he was associated with John Cul- 
bertson, may be taken as evidence. John 
Culbertson was a Scotch Covenanter and mis- 
sionary. In 1764 or 1766 he came to Wash- 
ington county on a mission to the Secession 
church. He was accompanied on this long 
and perilous trip by Phineas Whiteside, who 
made permanent location in West Cambridge. 
He purchased a tract of fourteen hundred 
acres which he cleared in part and cultivated. 
The war of the revolution prevented his get- 
ting title to the land which he held on per- 
petual lease at a rental of one shilling per 
acre. The land was not held in "fee simple" 
until 1877, when it was purchased. As his 
sons came of age he gave them each two 
hundred acres of land. The homestead he 
erected is still standing and owned by a de- 
scendant, Mrs. Catherine Hobson. He was 
a very patriotic man and during the war of 
the revolution espoused with fervor the colo- 
nial cause, subscribing one thousand pounds 
to aid the colonial government. He also ex- 
erted himself in behalf of some soldiers who 
were being tried for desertion. He defended 
them with much skill and restored them to 
their commands. His wife at her death left 
one hundred pounds for the erection of a 
church in the locality, other members of the 
family contributed enough to complete it. It 
has always been known as the "Whiteside 
church." • He married Ann Cooper, while yet 
a resident of Pennsylvania. Children, the 
sons all settled on farms in the town : John,

STEWART name has been familiar in 
Scotch and English history 
for centuries. The founder of the Mont- 
gomery county family was Donald Stewart,

line. He emigrated to the United States about 
the year 1800, settling on a farm in Mont- 
gomery county, town of Amsterdam, on what

a violent manner, September 12. 1884. He 
was riding an unruly horse which threw him,

tivity may be inferred from the fact pf his 
attempting to ride a fractious horse at his then

to America in 1760. The family tradition is 
that the young couple ran away to get married 
and chose America as the place where they 
would begin their married life. They had a 
quick voyage over, but when almost within 
sight of the shores of America a storm drove 
their vessel far out to sea and delayed their 
landing several weeks. They settled in Dut- 
chess county. New York, where John died in 
1810. They had sons: Solomon, George. 
John, David, Samuel and Frederick. John

This branch of the Lansing 
L.-\NSING family setled in or near Co- 
hoes about 1760. They de- 
scend from Gerrit Lansing, the founder, and 
date in the Mohawk Valley from about the

ing on land that is part of the original grant 
from the King or his representatives. For 
detailed genealogy see the Lansings of Al- 
bany, Troy and Cohoes. The particular 
branch of the family that is here considered is 
closely allied with the Fonda family of .Al- 
bany county, descendants of Jellise Dounse 
Fonda, who was in Beverwyck as early as 
1650. In a later generation the only child 
and daughter of a wealthy Fonda married a 
Lansing, thus uniting two large estates. The 
descent of Alida M. Lansing from Gerrit 
Lansing, the founder, is through eight gener- 
ations, she being the ninth.

This family is of English ancestry 
PITTS and was founded in America by 
John Pitts, son of Berwick Pitts, 
•of Lyme, Regis county, Dorset, England, a 
small seaport of the southern coast. Here 
John was born in 1668 and came to America 
in 1695, settling in Boston, where he was a 
successful and prominent merchant. He mar- 
ried Elizabeth Lendall, of Duxbury, Massa- 
chusetts, granddaughter of James Lendall, of 
England, who died in 1652. His will was 
witnessed by Miles Standis'h and John .Mden. 
John Pitts had a son James, who graduated 
at Harvard in 1728, and rose to a high posi- 
tion in the colony. He was a noted patriot 
and with his sons, John, Samuel and Lendall, 
at his side, equally devoted to the cause of 
liberty, walked the stormy path of the revo- 
lution when failure led to the scaffold, the axe 



or the gallows, and success led to liberty, free- 
dom and glory. It was a family noted in the 
annals of early Massachusetts, where Pitts 
street, Pitts wharf and Pitts tomb are yet to 
be found. The family is now scattered, but 
few if any are to be found in or around Bos- 
ton who can justly claim descent from James. 
There is no record to connect the New York 
family of Colonic, Albany county, with the 
Boston family. They trace five generations 
to William Pitts, of Chatham, Columbia 
county, who was son of Joseph. There were 
several of the name resident of the town of 
Chatham, where their descendants are still to 
be found. 

(I) William Pitts, son of Joseph Pitts, was 
born in the town of Chatham, Columbia 
county. New York. He was a school teacher 
in his younger days, but later a farmer. He 
was a devoted Methodist and a class leader in 
that church, and was of the Democratic faith. 
As a boy he recalled the incidents of the revo- 
lution and often told of his visits when a boy 
to the camp of the soldiers, driving cattle 
which were to be killed for their sustenance. 
He married (first) Salome Wickham, who 
bore him twelve children; (second) Charity 
Couse, who was the mother of two. 

(II) David W., son of William and Salome 
(Wickham) Pitts, was born in the town of 
Nassau, Rensselaer county. New York, where 
his father had removed from Columbia county. 
He also followed the occupation of a farmer 
all his days. He enlisted and served in the 
American army during the war of 1812-14. 
He was a prominent and useful member of 
the Methodist church and an ardent Democrat. 
He married Susanna, daughter of Ebenezer 
Boyce, of the town of Schodack, where she 
was born. They were the parents of thirteen 
children. 

(III) Sylvester, son of David W. and Su- 
sanna (Boyce) Pitts, was born in Nassau, 
Rensselaer county. New York, April 4, 1818, 
died in Colonic, Albany county, March 27, 
1886. He was a farmer of Colonie all his 
adult years and prospered. He was a con- 
sistent member of the Methodist church, a 
good but not an austere man, liberal in 
thought and deed and highly respected in his 
community. He departed from the family 
political faith and joined the Republican party 
when the party was formed. He was em- 
phatically a home man, holding no public 
office nor belonging to any fraternal organi- 
zations, lie married, in 1849, Mary Ann

This family now in the 
BUHRMASTER second American gen- 
eration is native to the 
town of Minden, Westphalia, Empire of Ger- 
many. Through intermarriage, however, they 
are connected with one of the old revolution- 
ary families of the Mohawk \'alley. Dutch 
and German blood in that section has inter- 
mingled with that of other nations and pro- 
duced a race of men and women in which the 
essentially Teutonic traits, thrift and frugal- 
ity, predominate. The first of this family to 
come to America was Christian Buhrmaster, 
who descended from a long line of German 
ancestors, hardy farmers of the former king- 
dom of Westphalia, now a constituent part of 
the German Empire. 

(I) Frederick Ikihrmaster was born on his 
father's farm in the town of Minden, West- 
phalia, Prussia, in the year 1820, died there in 
1907. He followed the usual family vocation, 
farming, all his life. He married a girl of 
the same province, Caroline, born about 1830, 
died in 1899, daughter of Frederick Bartling, 
a worthy man, and like the Buhrmasters a 
faithful member of the Lutheran church. Be- 
sides his daughter Caroline he was the father 
of Frederick Bartling and other children, one 
of whom survives, 1909, a resident of Minden. 
Frederick Buhrmaster and his wife were the 
parents of six children: i. Frederick (2), who 



came to the United States, settled in Amster- 
dam, New York, where he married Carrie- 
Shumyer; children: Anna, Frederick (3), 
Edward and Henry. 2. Mary, married a 
farmer of her native town, where they reside.. 
3. Henry, who also came to the United States*, 
settled in the town of Florida, Montgomery 
county. New York ; married Sophia Shumyer ;■ 
children : Charles, Emma, Lena, Mattie. 4. 
Christian F., see forward. 5. Charles, a 
farmer of Minden, living on the Buhrmaster 
homestead ; married, and has a family. 6: 
Sophia, resides in Minden with her brother 
Charles ; unmarried. 

(II) Christian F., fourth child of Frederick 
and Caroline (Bartling) Buhrmaster, was 
born in Minden, Westphalia, Prussia, Decem- 
ber 9, 1864. He received the customary edu- 
cation of the German public schools which- 
fairly equipped him for life's battle in the- 
far-away land to which he emigrated in the 
year 1882. He sailed from Bremen on the 
steamship "Elba," and landed in New York 
City in April of that year. He did not long 
remain there, but soon is found in jMontgom- 
ery county, \vhere he worked at farming, the 
occupation he had followed in Westphalia. He 
was then just past sixteen years of age. He- 
possessed those two essentials to success, in- 
dustry and thrift. After years of effort and 
frugality he became, by purchase, the owner 
of two hundred acres of land in the town of 
Florida, part of an historical estate near 
Scotchbush. He has since resided on this 
farm, which he has greatly improved. He is 
interested particularly in fine stock breeding, 
although the products of his farm are of the- 
usual character general in the neighborhood. 
He is a Presbyterian in religion, and a Demo- 
crat in politics. He married, in Florida, De- 
cember 24, 1893, Emma Jane Hutton. born 
there September i, 1873. She descends from- 
an old Columbia county family that settled in 
Montgomery county about the year 1800 (see 
forward). Children of Christian F. and Emma 
J. (Hutton) Buhrmaster: Roy H., born June 
15. 1895, and C. W. Fay, born November 4, 
1897. Mrs. Buhrmaster is also a member of 
the Presbyterian church. 

(The Hutton Line). 

Mrs. Christian F. Buhrmaster (Emma Jane- 
Hutton) descends from Christopher Hutton, 
born in Colurnbia county. New York, about 
1750. He removed to Troy, New York. He 
enlisted in the revolutionary army and served' 
also on the Troy committee of safety. He- 
married and had issue.

The date of this particular 
SMITH branch of the Smith family in 

Montgomery county, New York, 
is somewhat obscure, but taking the facts as 
known, 1780 approximates the year of the 
migration of Charles Smith from New Jer- 
sey, where he was born about 1760. He was 
married about this time, and it was a very 
young bride who helped him make a home in 
the then wilderness of southern Glen. But the

In an old graveyard at Larison 
FISHER Corner, New Jersey, is the 
grave of Peter Fisher. Whence 
he came to this country and when is not 
known. From a careful examination of the 
old records it would seem that he could not 
have settled in New Jersey later then 1725, 
with the strong probability that it was much 
earlier. His wife's name was Maria, believed 
to have been born in Germany and most likely 
married there. Peter Fisher, upon his re- 



moval to New Jersey, settled in Somerset 
county, where he remained until 1730, when 
he removed to Hunterdon county, where he 
purchased a two-hundred-acre farm ; the deed 
bears date of March 30, 1730, and states the 
consideration to have been £132 of "lawful 
silver money." He had eight children, the 
eldest born 1725: Anthony, John, Elizabeth, 
Christopher. John, Peter. Jacob, and another 
daughter. Christopher, born 1730, married 
Charity Boss and had six children. It is from 
Christopher that the Fishers of Montgomery 
county here under consideration are believed 
to descend, but the connection cannot be defi- 
nitely traced.

stant exhibitions of active muscular patriotism

caused a reward of one hundred pounds to be 
offered for their heads : but they outwitted 
their enemies and came through the war 
safely. Andrew Frank, son of the patriot,

The Eraser family is one of the 
ERASER ancient ones of Scotland, and a 
number of worthy members of 
it have become citizens of the United States. 
The particular branch of which this sketch 
treats is descended from the Lord Lovet clan, 
and has been domiciled in this country for a 
number of generations. The representatives 
of the family in the present generation are the 
Misses Altonah and Elizabeth Nevius Eraser, 
who were born in Athens. New York. Rob- 
ert Eraser, a brother of John Eraser, spoken 
of hereinafter, was engaged in the lumber 
business in the Bay of Honduras, died there 
and left a considerable estate. Word was 
sent to John Eraser, at "some place on the 
Hudson River," as the document read, but as 
travel was attended with great difficulties in 
those days, no steps were ever taken to ac- 
quire title to this property, and it probably 
passed into the hands of the partner of 
Robert. 

(I) John Eraser, the first of the family of 
whom we have detailed information, came 
from Edinburg, Scotland, at the age of eight- 
een years, and settled in Athens, New York, 
where he followed the occupation of cabinet- 
making. He was a stanch supporter of the 
Democratic party in politics, taking an active 
interest in all matters which concerned the 
public welfare, and his religious affiliations 
were with the Methodist church. He mar- 
ried, July 31, 1796, Patience Bradwell, and 
had children: Mary, born September 17, 1797; 



William, September 27, 1799; Hannah, July 
17, 1801 ; Jane .Ann, January 7, 1804; George 
Bradwell, March 12. 1806, see forward; Rob- 
ert H., July 25, 1808; Eliza, August i, 1810; 
Sarah Ann, March 3, 1821. Patience (Brad- 
well) Eraser was the daughter of General Ja- 
cob Bradwell, of revolutionary fame, who 
lived at Coeymans, New York, and married 
Mary Guackin. The latter was the daughter 

of Guackin, who married Patience 

Potts, born in Pennsylvania, educated at the 
Moravian School in liethlehem, from whence 
she was married. 

(H) George Bradwell, second son of John 
and Patience (Bradwell) Eraser, was born in 
Athens, New York, March 12, 1806, died Sep- 
tember 14, 1884. He established and con- 
ducted a factory for the manufacture of stone 
ware, in which enterprise he was eminently 
successful, as he was in a number of other 
matters which he took in hand. He was at 
one time president of West Troy, New York, 
director and vice-president of Bank of West 
Troy for a number of years, and in church 
affairs took a prominent part, being vestry- 
man, junior and senior warden for a number 
of years of Trinity Church at Watervliet, 
New York. 

Mr. Eraser married, April 20, 183 1. Catha- 
rine Tolley : children : Mary Jane. Hannah. .M- 
tonah and Elizabeth Nevius. Catharine (Tol- 
ley) Eraser, born July 28, 1810, died Febru- 
ary 15, 1872, was the daughter of George Tol- 
ley and granddaughter of Dr. Frederick Tol- 
ley, who arrived at New York, August 12, 
1753, having come from the Electorate of 
Hanover, Germany. He married, March 13, 
1760, Catharine Voland, and had children: 
Henry B., born December 15, 1762; John 
Philip, March 11, 1766; Catharine, December 
5, 1767; John Frederick, August 28, 1769; 
George, the father of Catharine (Tolley) 
Eraser: and William, born .April 12, 1781. 

(HI) Altonah and Elizabeth Nevius, the 
two youngest children of George Bradwell and 
Catharine (Tolley) Eraser, were born in .Ath- 
ens, New York, leaving there when infants, 
their parents moving to Watervliet. Tiiey at- 
tended for a number of years the Willard 
Seminary, where they received an excellent 
education, and this has been supplemented 
during the entire course of their lives by read- 
ing and study. They are members and faith- 
ful attendants at the services of the Episcopal 
church, in whose interests they are active. 
Their interest in music is a deep and lifelong 
one, and they are associate members of the 
Vocal, Choral and Chromatic societies, and are 
in all the entertainments which are instituted 
bv these associations.

The history of the Norton 
NORTON family begins at tlie time of 

the Norman Conquest, when 
Le Signeur de Norville crossed over to Eng- 
land with King William the Conqueror, Sep- 
tember 29, 1022, and was his constable. The 
name at that time was Norville, which in 
French signified North Village. The name 
was afterward changed to Norton, which in 
English means North-town. It is supposed 
that all the families of this name in England, 
Ireland and America were derived from one 
man. 

(I) Benjamin Norton was a descendant of 
John Norton, of Branford, Connecticut. He 
was born in Stonington, Connecticut, 1793, 
died in Rome, New York, 1834. He served 
in the war of 18 12. He married Nancy Gor- 
don, of Scotch descent, at Albany, New York. 

(II) Cornelius H., son of Benjamin and 
Nancy (Gordon) Norton, was born in Rome, 
New York, August 27. 1828, died in Glovers- 
ville, New York, April 15, 1900. He mar- 
ried Sarah Darrow, born in Rome, New York, 
April II, 1824, died January i, 1901, in Glov- 
ersville. New York, daughter of Captain 
Pliny Darrow (whose ancestors were of revo- 
lutionary fame) and Sarah (Martin) Darrow. 

(III) Alfred Darrow Norton, son of Cor- 
nelius H. and Sarah (Darrow) Norton, was 
born in Mexico, New York, January 31, 1851. 
He succeeded his father in the jewelry busi- 
ness, coming to Gloversville from Rome in 
1869, and has successfully conducted the 
same to the present time (191 1). He is con- 
sidered one of the most prominent and suc- 
cessful jewelers in the Mohawk Valley and 
Central New York. He married (first), Oc- 
tober 28, 1877, in Kingsboro. New York. 
Susie, daughter of Jonathan and Mary A. 
Wooster; died June 12, 1879; married (sec- 
ond). May 25. i88r, Phoebe D. Briggs, of 
Fonda, New York, daughter of Delavan and 
Almira (Dockstader) Briggs. 



Samuel .Mien, a farmer of the 
ALLEN town of Galway, Saratoga 

county. New York, married Cath- 
erine Cole. They continued their residence 
in Saratoga county until 1855, when they re- 
moved to Fulton county, which was their 
residence until. death. Children: John C, see 
forward : Sarah, married John R. Berry, who 
afterwards associated with her brother, John 
C. Allen, in glove manufacture: Lucy E., un- 
married ; Rebecca, married .'Xmatus R. Bel- 
lows, and had a daughter Beulah : Clara, mar- 
ried James Billings : Mary, married Timothy 
Davenport, and had Allen and Marion. 

(II) John C, son of Samuel and Catherine 



(Cole) Allen, was born in the town of Gal- 
way, Saratoga county, New York, January 27, 
1838, died at Gloversville, New York. July 30, 
1909. He was educated in the Galway schools, 
and was a resident there until he reached his- 
seventeenth year, when the family residence 
was removed to Gloversville. New York. For 
several years after locating in Gloversville, he 
learned the process of tanning leather and the 
manufacture of gloves, and became thor- 
oughly familiar with every detail of these in- 
dustries. He had become possessed also of 
some capital, and in 1873, in company with 
John R. Berry, began the manufacture of 
gloves under the firm name of Berry & Allen, 
succeeding to a business established in 1846. 
This was a most successful enterprise, and 
continued until the death of Mr. Berry in 
1890, when Mr. Allen became the sole owner 
and continued the business. In 1900 he ad- 
mitted his son, Harry John Allen, as partner,, 
and the firm became J. C. Allen & Son. This 
firm became one of the largest glove-making 
concerns of Fulton county, and continued as 
J. C. Allen & Son until the death of the 
father, when it became an incorporation, un- 
der the name of J. C. ,\llen & Sons. Mr. 
.'\llen possessed special aptitude for business 
life, had intense powers of application, good 
executive ability, coupled with courage and an 
indomitable will. He won a success in life 
that was well deserved. He stood high among 
his brother manufacturers in the trade, who 
chose him president of the Fulton County 
Glove Manufacturers' .Association, of which 
organization he was always an active, inter- 
ested member. He was also a Inember of 
the board of directors of the Fulton County 
National Bank, and was a valuable member of 
that board. Business interests, while carefully 
managed, did not make up the sum total of his 
activities. His deep interest in church and 
Sunday-school work, the public schools, the 
public library and other Gloversville public 
institutions, was one of his prominent charac- 
teristics. Public-spirited to an unusual de- 
gree, nothing that tended to promote the com- 
mon good failed of his support. His love of 
music was a marked trait, and to him is 
largely due the introduction of musical in- 
struction in the public schools. He served in 
the public library as a member of the board 
of directors, and was always a warm friend 
of the free library. He was one of the orig- 
inal members of the First Presbyterian Church 
of Gloversville, which he served for twenty- 
five years as ruling elder. His interest in the 
Sunday-school was equally marked and con- 
tinued all through life. He never grew old, 
save in years, but retained his youtiiful sjiirit.

(HI) George (2), son of George (i) Get- 
man, was born in Ephratah, Fulton county, 
New York, about the year 1770. He was a 
captain in the war of 1812. He was a farmer 
of Ephratah all his life. He married Cath- 
erine Cook and had six sons. 

(IV) David, son of George (2) and Cath- 
erine (Cook) Getman, was born in 1809 in 
Ephratah, Fulton county, New York, died 
March 3, 1890. He removed to the town of 
Mayfield, same county, in 1846, and engaged 
in mercantile life, continuing until 1863, when 
he retired. He was a justice of the peace for 
twenty years, and an active worker and liberal 
supporter of the Dutch Reformed church of 
Mayfield. He married Mary Burdick, also 
born in Ephratah. They had five children, 
two only arriving at maturity. David, of 
whom further ; Sarah. 

(V) David (2), son of David (i) and 
Mary (Burdick) Getman, was born in Ephra- 
tah, Fulton county, New York, January 21, 
1836. He was educated in the public schools 
and Kingsboro Academy, where he was grad- 
uated. When he was ten years of age his 
parents removed to Mayfield and after David 
had completed his studies he worked as a 

.clerk in his father's store. At the outbreak 
of the civil war he enlisted, August, 1861, in 
Company I, Seventh Regiment, New York 
Volunteers. This company was recruited in 
F"ulton county and was mustered into the 
United States service, October 30, i86i. He 
was commissioned first lieutenant, later cap- 
tain, and assigned to the Tenth Regiment, 
New York Cavalry. His army record is ex- 
ceedingly honorable, and is thus recorded in 
the history of the Tenth Regiment. 

"Captain David Getman, Jr., age twenty-six, 
commissioned from Ma>-field, October 17, 1862, with 
rank from September 17, 1862, mustered in October 
30. 1862, wounded by saber-cut of arm and taken 
prisoner at Brandy Station, Virginia, June 9, 1863 ; 
escaped while in transit near Winnsboro, North 
Carolina, February 14, 1865; arrived in General 
Sherman's army February 21, 1865; returned to 
duty June 3, 1865; transferred June 24, 1865, to 
Company L, First New York, Prov. Cavalry. 

"The first and only captain of the initial com- 
pany of the new battalion was David Getman, Jr. 
This officer entered the service as Captain of Com- 
pany I and remained as such to the termination of 
its service. .'\t the time of the dissolution of the 
regiment he was transferred as Captain to Com- 
pany L of the First New York, Prov. Cavalry. No 
braver knight or more courteous gentleman ever 
led men to battle. He came of fighting stock, his 
grandfather George Getman, being an officer in the 
American army in the war of 1812. Captain David 
Getman, Jr., in civil as well as military life has 
exhibited a dignity of character and a spirit of 
enterprise that causes his fellow-citizens to 
mention his name with pride. While in 
Libby Prison, on the sixth day of July, 
186^; his name, with seventy-four other 



prisoners of the rank of captain, was 
placed in a ballot-box, from which two names 
(Captain Sawj'er, of the First New Jersey Cav- 
alry, and Captain Flinn, of the Fifty-first Indiana 
Irifantry) were drawn for execution. President 
Lincoln (informed of the circumstances by Mrs. 
Sawyer, who had received a letter from her hus- 
band) held General W. H. F. Lee and Captain 
Winder, hostages for Sawyer and Flinn. and they 
were subsequently exchanged by special order from 
the Confederate War Department. Captain Get- 
man, with other officers, was for sixty-four days 
under fire in the city of Charlestown, South Caro- 
lina. General Foster had erected batteries on Mor- 
ris Island and was shelling the city, inflicting seri- 
ous damage. In order to save it from destruction 
these officers were placed in this position, and 
General Foster was notified that he jeopardized 
his comrades if he continued firing. It failed. 
However, it had the desired effect, as Foster 
erected other batteries and increased his fire, which 
resulted in the Federal officers being removed to 
Columbia, South Carolina. A man of excellent 
judgment. Captain Getman so regulated his habits 
and daily life while a prisoner of war that he 
emerged from the terrible ordeal with less of the 
evil effects than most of his associates. He has 
always manifested a deep interest in the members 
of the regiment, the feeling partaking of the 
paternal in regard to those who composed his old 
company." 

After the war he returned to Fulton county, 
New York, where until 1880 he was engaged 
chiefly in the purchase and sale of patent 
rights. He employed at times a score of men 
and double teams and carried on a very large 
and profitable business. In 1880 he began 
operations in real estate and made many of 
Gloversville's most substantial improvements. 
The Getman and Choral Union blocks, now 
known as the Martin & Nailor and \\'eed & 
Willoughby department stores, are monu- 
ments to the activity during this period of his 
eventful life. He purchased a farm in May- 
field where he indulged his love for horses and 
stock to the utmost. He built a track for 
training purposes and has owned some of the 
best horses in the county. Recently he pur- 
chased the old Judson mansion on Kingslxjro 
Heights, surrounded by two acres of land, 
where he intends to found the David and 
Helen Getman Old Ladies' Home. Denied 
children of his own Mr. Getman had taken 
unusual interest in young men, two of whom 
he educated and furnished with clothes during 
their school years. During his long life he 
has strictly adhered to principles of sobriety 
and abstinence from hotli liquor and tobacco. 
He is a Republican in politics, and for many 
years was notary public and was the first 
elected president of the village of Mayfield. 
He is a member of Canby Post, Graml .Army 
of the Republic ; the Veteran Association ; the 
Cavalry Society of the ITnited States : the 
Sons of Veterans of Glovcrsvillc, and named

honor. He was made a Mason nearly half a

receiv'ing from the New York Grand Lodge a 
special dispensation to receive the three de- 
grees in less than the constitutional time. He 
is a member of Gloversville Lodge, No. 429.

man, using his wealth in and for churches, 
schools, hospitals and other charitable insti- 
tutions. He is well known and everywhere

ange and Waalbogt, was born in the latter part 
of the si.xtecnth century in Holland (probably 
at Tirlamont). and died in Swaanendacl.

land and Spain, and emigrated with his wife, 
two children and two servants to .America on 
the .ship "New Netherlands" in 1632. He was 
one of those detailed to I)uild Fort Orange.

to return to New .Amsterdam, he and his fam- 
ily settled at Waal-I'.ogt. Wishing to visit 
the colony at Swaancmlael. he took with him 
his sons, Pierre and llcndrick, and was killed

by the Indians in the fort, he at that time be- 
ing sick. His wife was Sophia Ter Bosch, 
born in Holland. After the death of her hus-

Roelantsen, the first school teacher in New

Martin and Sophia (Ter Bosch) Wiltsee, was 
born in Waal-Bogt, New York. He was on 
the sea in 1623, coming to America with his 
parents, but must have been then a young boy. 
He and his brother Pierre are said to have 
been taken prisoners by the Indians when the 
settlement at Swaanendael was destroyed and 
their father killed, in 1632. They were taken 
to Quebec in 1633 and given to the Jesuit 
fathers, who kept them a year under their 
training. They were then taken to the Huron 
country, and made their escape in 1640. They 
spent two years at Esopus trading with the 
Indians, then went to sea for several years as 
sailors. Hendrick M. was a freeholder in 
Newtown, Long Island, in 1655. In 1658 he 
went from Fort Orange to Quebec with the 
Mohawk Indians as interpreter. He had a 
lawsuit in New Amsterdam in 1660. He was 
commander of a vessel in that year, and wrote 
a letter to Governor Stuyvesant from the 
Island of Aruba, Dutch Antilles. He was a 
soldier in Kingston, New York, between 1660 
and 1667, and was erroneously reported killed 
in 1663. He had a son Hendrick, baptized in 
New Amsterdam, 1669. He was on the list 
of inhabitants in Newtown, Long Island, in 
1675, and purchased land at Hell Gate in 
1681. He was mentioned in the Newtown 
patent by Governor Dongan in 1686. Up to 
about 1690 his name is always written Hen- 
drick Martensen, then he began to assume his 
ancient tribal, or national, name in signing 
documents and records. On the baptismal rec- 
ord of the old Dutch church in New York City 
where his granddaughter, Margaretta, was 
baptized July 6, 1701, his name is signed

Montgomery county. N e w 
SEEGER York, has always had a great 
attraction for the German peo- 
ple, and perhaps from no particular section of 
Germany have more families settled there than 
from Westphalia. They have always proved 
desirable citizens, and have added materially 
to the wealth of the country. 

(I) Martin Seeger, with whom this family 
record begins, was born in Greifenburg. West- 
phalia, Germany (then Prussia), in 1803. His 
parents also lived and died in that town. Mar- 
tin was in the employ of a wealthy resident of 
the town for many years previous to the date 
of his death in 1855. He married Marie Dorn, 
born in the same province ; she survived her 
Tiusband. and at the request of her children 
joined them in the United States, where she 
died in Amsterdam, New York, at the home 
of her daughter Hannah, at the age of ninety- 
two. Roth Martin and Marie (Dorn) Seeger 



were members of the German Lutheran church. 
They were the parents of eleven children, who 
grew to maturity, five of these came to the 
United States, and will be named: i. Ernest, 
settled in Iowa in 1870. and died at the age 
of forty-five, unmarried. 2. Herman, served

(II) Fred Augustus, son of Martin and 
Marie (Dorn) Seeger, was born in Greifen- 
burg, Westphalia, Germany, April 22, 1846. 
He grew up in his native village, and when 
nineteen enlisted in the public civil service 
and served for three and one-half years. The 
war with France broke out shortly after his 
discharge from the service, and he at once 
enlisted in the service of the fatherland. He 
joined the ranks of the cavalry, Plummer regi- 
ment No. 2 Passawalk. and saw hard service, 
as that regiment was in many engagements. 
He was in the ranks something over a year 
and escaped without a scratch, laying down 
his iron shield and hood at the close of the 
war, he says "with regret,'" as he liked the 
life of a .soldier. He received an honorable 
discharge, and in 1872 with his brother Her- 
man took passage from Bremen for New 
York, where they arrived April 7. 1872. He 
soon came to Amsterdam, where he worked 
for the farmers until his marriage, when he 
leased land and farmed on his own account. 
In 1884 he purchased a good farm of one 
hundred and twenty acres near Hagaman, 
town of Amsterdam, uix)n which he settled 
and remained until 1906. when he sold the 
farm to his son and retired from active life.

The Crandalls of Rhode Isl- 
CRANDELL and are of Welsh descent, 

the name in that language 
being Craum Dell, meaning. Iron Dell. The 
name is spelled both Crandall and Crandell, 
tlie branch settling in Ghent, Columbia 
county. New York, using the latter form. Sev- 
eral of the name arrived at Boston, Massa- 
chusetts, as early as 1634. The ancestor of 
the New York branch. Rev. John Crandall, 
appears in Massaclnisetts records in 1635. At 
that time the persecution of Roger Williams 
was causing great excitement in the colonies, 
many being opposed to the extreme measures 
of the Puritans. In the autumn of 1635 the 
church at Salem dismissed him from their 
pulpit and he was ordered to leave the col- 
ony in six weeks. In the winter of 1636 the 
authorities at Boston ordered his arrest, but 
he learned their plans and fled into the wil- 
derness, reaching Narragansett liay in the 
spring. He was treated kindly by the Sa- 
chems of Narragansett Indians, from whom 
he obtained large grants of land and founded 
the city of Providence. Rev. John Crandall

This family descends from 
McQUADE the famous O'Neil clan of 

Ireland and trace their his- 
tory back to the tenth century. The Amer- 
ican head of the family is Anthony McQuade, 
born in county Fermanagh, Ireland, son of 
Peter and Susan (McDermott) McQuade, 
grandson of Anthony and Catherine (Mc- 
Nabb) McQuade, great-grandson of Raymond 
and Sarah (McKeough) McQuade. The 
family was originally seated in county Ty- 
rone,Mac Cathmhaoil of Cinel-Fearadhaigh, 
pronounced Mac Cawell of Kinel-Farry, being 



the ancestral name of the McQuades of Ty- 
rone. Authorities: "Annals of Ireland," by 
the Four Masters; "Annals of Ulster," pub- 
lished by authority of the British Govern- 
ment ; "O'Neills of Ulster," by Matthews. 

The territory of Cinel-Fearadhaigh, the 
patrimonial inheritance of the .Mac Cathmha- 
oil, the descendants of Fergal, son of Muiread- 
hach (Murrough), son o"f Eoghan (Owen), 
son of Niall of the Nine Hostages (monarch 
of Ireland), was nearly co-extensive with the 
barony of Clogher in county of Tyrone. 

The Cinel-Fearadhaigh, viz. : the Clan- 
Aengus (Magennis), Clan-Duibhinreacht, 
Clan-Fogarty, all of Tyrone, and the Ily-Kcn- 
noda (Kennedy) and the Clan-CoUa, both of 
Fermanagh, were under the leadership of Mac 
Cathmhaoil, Lord of Cinel-Fearadhaigh. The 
lly-Kennoda gave name to the barony of Tir- 
kennedy in the east of Fermanagh, adjoining 
the barony of Clogher in Tyrone. 

The family of Mac Cathmhaoil, a name gen- 
erally anglicized to Mac Cawell or Mac Cagh- 
well, and Latinized Cavellus, who supplied 
several bishops to the See of Clogher, are still 
numerous in their ancient territory (southern 
Tyrone and northern Fermanagh), and the 
name is found in other counties anglicized 
variously as Campbell, Caulfield, and Howell. 

From "O'Neills of Ulster" : O'Duggan in 
his topographical poem written about A.D. 
1350, describing the ruling tribes of Ulster, 
says : 

The festive Cinel Fearadhaigh 
Constantly noble are their genealogies 
A clan without disgrace from their arms 
And the warlike Clan Cathmhaoil 
The two eastern septs are of every tribe 
In the high Cinel Fearadhaigh. 
Cinel-Fearadhaigh or Cincl-Farry, now the 
barony of Clogher, Tyrone county, the patri- 
mony of Mac Cawells or Mac Cathmhaoil. The 
Mac Cawells who were P.rehons (judges of the 
Brehon laws) in Cinel Owen (Tyrone) are fa- 
mous in Irish history for their learning and the 
many dignitaries they supplied to the church. 
In Cinel Owen about this time, A.T)., 1300. the 
Mac Cawells were the hereditary advisers of 
the king. The standard of the king of ,\ileach 
that day (Battle of Lcitherbe. A. D., 636). who 
was of the sept of the Mac Cawells (Cinel- 
Fearadhaigh). is stated to have been black and 
red. The king was Suibhne Meann. who was 
not only king of Aileach. but also monarch of 
Ireland (.\rd-Righ). at that time. In this battle 
Suibnhe Meann was overthrown. 

The name McQuade instead of Mac Cathm- 
haoil seems to have been adopted by the fam- 
ily as an iMiglish name about 1600. .\. D. Peter 
McQuade, who died October 18, 1855. who spoke 
Gaelic as well as English in speaking to his 
grandchildren, McQuade, frequentlly called 
them by their ancient Gaelic name Mac Cawell 
(Mac Cathmhaoil). The natives when speaking 
the Irish language always pronounce the name 
Mac Cawell.

The Irish annals show that the family Mac 
Cathmhaoil occupied the territory named above 
from the time of the assumption of family 
names A. D., and under the name Cinel- 
Fearadhaigh from the time of Niall of the 
Nine Hostages, A. D. Irish authors, annalists, 
say that a chief of this family, converted by 
St. Patrick, proceeded to the Isle of Man and 
converted the people of that island to Chris- 
tianity. His name was Maughold and a town 
of Man is called by his name and was the seat 
of his bishopric. The name Mac-Cathmhaoil 
(signifying "Son of the Hero in Battle") has 
■existed in Man from very early times and still 
continues there under the form of Cowell, like 
all Gaelic Manxnames having dropped the pre- 
fix Mac, meaning son. The head of the Irish 
militia, Fionn Mac Cuill, tradition says, was of 
this family. Fionn Mac Cuill is the great hero 
of legendary history, claimed alike by Ireland 
and also by Scotland under the name of Fingal. 
Ossian, the son of Fionn, has been immortalized 
by the researches of the Gaelic ' authors, 
prompted by the partial fabrications of Mac 
Pherson. 

The great Scotch family of Campbell is said 
to be a branch of the Mac Cathmhaoil, and 
Irish genealogists say that the Campbell arms, 
the gyronny of eight, is the common property 
of the Mac Cathmhaoils. 

Ancient maps showing the possessions of the 
•clans of Ireland before the confiscation of 
Ulster by the English, place the Mac Cathm- 
haoils in the southern part ct 'lyr.'iiv and the 
northern part of Fermanagh. 1 hi^ cnfi^cation 
deprived them as well as the c.tlur 1 rw'n clans 
of their ancestral possessions and tlitv became 
tenants where formerly they were masters. The 
Patent Rolls, James I., of England, from 1607 
and after, show numerous pardons to Mac 
Cawells and McQuades, for their rebellion, but 
few if any restorations of land. In these 
the variety in spelling the names shows that 
the English clerks were sorely put to straits 
when it came to spelling Irish names. Among 
these varieties are, McQuoyd, McQuod, ilc 
•Coade, Mc Quaide, Mc Quoad, and Mc Cooade. 
Mac Cathmhaoil is generally spelled McCawell 
or McCaghwell, sometimes McCuill, McCooel!, 
or Mc Cowell.

David Du Four, immigrant an- 
DE\'OE cestor, whose posterity spell the 

name Devoor, Devoe, etc., was a 
native of Mons, in Hainault, and when this 
place was threatened by the successes of the 
French in the Walloon districts, he retired 
with others of the family to Sedan, and after- 
wards to Amsterdam, where Du Four, though 



fitted by education for a better position, be- 
came a hopperman, or drayman. Left by the 
death of his wife, Mary Boulen, with a young 
child, Jean or John, born during their stay in 
Sedan, he married (second) Jeanne Frances, 
aged thirty-two, from Queivrain, a little east

with wife and son, he came to New York. 
After their arrival he settled in Harlem, where 
he obtained some ten morgens of land in 1662, 
and he was living there in 1674, when Nicho- 
las deVaux arrived. It is believed that the 
change in spelling was due to the similarity, 
perhaps the identity of the name with that of 
the new neighbor. In 1677 David and his son 
obtained a grant of sixty acres of land near 
Turtle bay on the East river, where he re- 
sided until his death, about 1698. Children

Peter Shumway, immigrant ancestor, was 
of French Huguenot ancestry. After the 
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, when many 
Huguenots sought refuge in .America, he 
came, before 1675, to Massachusetts and lo- 
cated in Topsfield. The name was originally 
spelled Chamois or Charmois. We are told 
that the home of the family in France was 
in the neighborhood of St. Maixent in tiie old 
province of Poitou. Peter Shumway came to 
this country before the time that Peter Fan- 
euil and other French Huguenots came, and 
he \vas not with the settlement at O.xford, 
Worcester county, Massachusetts, where his 
son, a few years later, was a settler. Peter 
Shumway lived for a time at Salem V'illage,

now Danvers, Massachusetts; was a soldier in 
King Philip's war, and on account of that 
service his son years afterwards petitioned for 
a grant of land, March 23, 1749-50, stating 
that his father was at the taking of the In- 
dian fort. Judging from his time of coming 
here, the fact that he did not speak or write 
French apparently and associated only with 
English settlers, it is hardly to be doubted 
that he came from some part of England 
thither and that his parents or earlier ances- 
tors went, like many others, for refuge to 
England. He was born in 1635. He was 
evidently frequently in the military service, 
for his son Peter says he was "a long time 
in the service of his country." He resided at 
Topsfield, according to his son's statement, 
and his wife attended church there and their 
children were baptized there. He was a hog- 
reeve in 1681-82 in Topsfield. His will was 
dated April 10, 1695, and his estate appraised 
June 10 of that year. In the will his resi- 
dence is given as Boxford. His wife Frances 
made her will April 3, 17 14, and gives her 
home as Topsfield. These towns were ad- 
joining and the families intimately associated, 
the boundary indistinct. Her will was proved 
August 2, 1714. Children: i. Peter, men- 
tioned below. 2. Samuel, born at Topsfield, 
November 2, 1681, probably lost at sea; un- 
married; estate settled in 1715 by brother 
John. 3. Dorcas, born October 16, 1683;

ham. 4. Joseph, born October 13. 16S6. died 
unmarried, 1715. 

(II) Peter (2), son of Peter (i) Shum- 
way, was born at Topsfield, June 6, 1678. 
Being the only son having sons, he is ancestor 
of all bearing the name of Shumway in this 
country. He removed from Topsfield to Ox- 
ford, Massachusetts, in the "Nipmuck Coun- 
try." He was granted the right of Joshua 
Chandler. He was one of the early settlers 
of Oxford in 1713, the original settlement by 
the thirty Huguenot families having been 
abandoned on account of Indian massacres 
and hostilities in 1696. None of the French 
returned. Peter Shumway spent the re- 
mainder of his days there. His will was dated 
May 12, 1741, and bequeaths to his wife and 
children. His home lot in Oxford embraced 
that now or lately, owned by Josiah Russell 
(H. 185). His family was one of the best- 
known and most-respected in the town of Ox- 
ford. He married (first) February n, 1701,

He was a staunch Whig, and it was rumored 
that an attempt was about to be made by the 
Tories and Indians to massacre him and his 
family. A neighboring Tory was appointed to 
go at night and shoot him in bed through the 
window, but fortunately, on the appointed 
night, his wife was awake, on account of a 
sick child, and after building a big fire in 
the fireplace had just laid down on the front 
side of the bed with the child, when the mur- 
derer came to the window. He weakened in 
his purpose when he saw that to kill the hus- 
band he would have to shoot the wife and 
child. She was a kindly, charitable woman, 
who had nursed the sick even in that man's 
own family. Afterward a blockhouse was 
built for the defense of the family. Van Horn 
was a member of the state assembly from 
1777 to 1781 and was high sheriff of Tryon

nah (^Babcnck) Conger, was born on the farm 
in P.crne. January 27, 1824, died at his home 
in Xew Scotland, September 7, 19 10. He was 
a farmer of his native town until 1850, when 
he purchased and removed to a farm of two 
hundred acres in New Scotland, near the vil- 
lage of Unionville. He became a man of 
abundant substance and a leader in his town. 
Hi? natural powers of conversation and argu- 
ment were unusual and were enhanced by a 
mind well-stored by serious study and wide 
reading. His manly character and open- 
handed generosity were proverbial. None 
were ever turned away empty-handed, and in 
his will he remembered those whose only 
claim was having been in his employ. His 
lifelong abstinence from the common habits of 
tobacco and liquor using was well known and 
widely commented upon. He was an earnest, 
zealous member of the Methodist Episcopal 
church, and a liberal supporter of all Chris- 
tian and charitable societies. Politically he 
was a Republican, but never sought public 
office. 

He married (first) in 1847, '" Berne, Xew 
York. Louisa Hotaling, born in the Helder- 
bergs. August 25, 1829, died May 9, 1872.

in his church and benevolent work and his 
valued co-worker in all things. She was a 
daughter of Aaron and Mary (Rogers) Hotal- 
ing. of Albany county. Mary (Rogers) 
Hotaling died in middle life, and .Xaron mar- 
ried a second wife, later removing to Albany, 
where he was engaged in the ice business. He 
had five children, the only survivor (1910) 
being Hiram Hotaling, born March 28, 1828, 
who resides with his widowed daughter, .Anna 
(Hotaling) Saxton, in Albany. William H.

degree her youthful vigor and giving little evi- 
dence of her seventy-nine years. She con-

church, of which she is a lifelong member. 
She is a daughter of Tunis W. and Magda-

formed church. Tunis W. was a son of Wil- 
liam Hotaling, who came to Albany county 
from Holland with two brothers and settled 
on adjoining farms south of Feurabush. This 
was prior to the revolution. They were a 
thrifty family and succeeded well in their 
new home. William Hotaling was twice mar- 
ried and had issue by both wives. Magdalena 
Winne. wife of Tunis W. Hotaling, was the 
daughter of Adam and Christianna (La 
Grange) Winne, early settlers of New Scot-

(The Millspaiigh Line). 
This name is found on the early records of 
Orange county as Miltzpatch, Miltzpach and 
Milsbagh. The emigrant was from Germany 
and canie to the United States accompanied by 
a grown-up family. The valley of the Wal- 
kill was settled by German, Dutch and Hugue- 



not emigrants, who, frugal and industrious, 
very soon became possessed of competence and 
wealth. The Millspaugh family settled in the 
town of Montgomery, Orange county. New 
York, about 1730. They were from Holland 
and Protestant in religion, from which they 
suffered persecution which led them to emi- 
grate to America. Jacob, the father, was evi- 
dently an old man, as the records do not men- 
tion any land purchased by him. The printed 
records of the family begins with his son, 
Matys (Matthias). 

(H) Matthias, son of Jacob Alillspaugh 
(Miltzpach), was born in Germany, as the 
journal of the New York assembly for 1735 
shows a bill for the naturalization of several 
persons, among them Matys ]Milsbagh, Philip 
Milsbagh and two members of the Crist fam- 
ily. This would indicate that he had reached' 
manhood before coming to America in 1730. 
Philip was evidently his brother. In 1738 
Henry Crist, Stevanus Crist and Matthias 
Miltzpach purchased of William Sharpus, of 
New York City (a patentee of the two-thou- 
sand-acre tract), four hundred and forty-two 
acres in the town of JMontgomery on the 
north side of Walkill, opposite the later day 
village of Montgomery, a little back of the 
stream. They had previously purchased two- 
hundred acres, known as the "Crist Mill Lot." 
The land was of the finest quality, deep and 
fertile. They divided their purchase and at 
once began to clear and cultivate. The first 
home was dug out of the side of a hill and 
there the family was comfortably housed until 
the dugout was replaced by a house of logs. 
They were an energetic family and soon were 
in fairly comfortable circumstances. They 
were members of the Dutch Reformed church, 
and with their neighbors of that faith erected 
a log church in which they worshipped for 
many years. Matthias married Elsie Kim- 
bark, daughter of one of the numerous French 
Huguenots, who like their Holland co-religion- 
ists found the Walkill \'alley a safe and pleas- 
ant refuge. The Kimbarks first settled in 
Ulster county near Kingston, but later joined 
their brethren in the Walkill \'alley, where 
thev afterward lived and died. 

(Ill) Charles, son of Matthias and Elsie 
(Kimbark) Millspaugh. was born in the town 
of Crawford, then Montgomery, Orange 
county. New York, January 18. 1781 ; the 
town of Crawford was erected from Mont- 
gomery in 1823. He received a share of his 
father's estate to which he added by purchase, 
becoming a prosperous farmer and highly re- 
.spected citizen. He married Mehitable Van' 
Tassel, born in Orange county. New York, 
August 9, 1781, a descendant of Jan Cornelius

■which among other things recites : 

Notwithstanding the enemy have not left us

(I\') Rev. Alexander Millspaugh, son of

paugh. was born in Orange county, New 
York, town of Montgomery, January 12. 1810, 
died at Feurabush (Jerusalem), town of New 
Scotland, Albany county. New York, Decem- 
ber 5, 1885. He was educated in the schools 
of Orange county and prepared for the minis- 
try at Rutgers Theological Seminary, New 
Brunswick, New Jersey, from whence he was 
graduated with honors, class of 1842. He was 
ordained a minister of the Dutch Reformed 
church, and spent his subsequent life engaged 
in that holy profession. He was for twenty- 
five years pastor over the Middletown church. 
Afonmouth county. New Jersey, and during 
his quarter of a century in that field built up 
a strong congregation and did good and faith- 
ful work for his Master. He was not only 
an acceptable pulpit orator, but the "beloved 
pastor," known far and near in the county. 
His second pastorate was assumed in response 
to a call from the congregation in New Scot- 
land, which he accepted and where he passed 
a life of great usefulness, continuing in the 
active ministry until his death. He married 
Sarah A. Barriclo. born in Marlboro, New Jer- 
sey, August 14, 1818, died in the village of

The Gordon family is doubt- 
GOIvDOX less of Norman origin, but was 
prominent in Scotland before 
the year 11 50. No Scotch surname is more 
honored and perhaps none more widely known. 
The family is found as early as 1150 in .Aber- 
deenshire. Kirkcidbrightshire. Banffshire, Ber- 
wickshire, Sutherlandshire and in other coun- 
ties of Scotland. The family possess the 
dukedom and marquisate of Gordon and Hunt- 
ley : earldoms of Aberdeen, Aboyne, Eozie. 
Huntley, Moray; viscounties of Formartine, 
Inverness, Kenmure, Meldrum ; lordships of 
Badenoch, etc., Haddo. etc., Lochinvar, 
Strathaven. etc. \'arious branches bear coats- 
of-arms. A branch of the family went to 
Scotland about 161 o when Ulster was settled 
by the Scotch Presbyterians by order of King 
James, and many of the .Vmerican Gordons 
descend from this branch. 

Before the revolution the family was numer- 
ous in New York state. The New York revo- 
lutionary rolls show that .\hraham, Charles, 
Robert, Alexander, Cornelius. Lieutenant- 
Colonel James, Joseph and William Gordon 
were in the service. Doubtless there were 
others. Joseph, Charles and Robert were of 
Albany county. 

Charleston was part of the old town of Mo- 
hawk, and was incorporated in 1793. .Ac- 
cording to the town history, Ezra Gordon 
was one of the numerous New England set- 
tlers who came there directely after the revo- 
lution. The county of Montgomery was set 
ofT from .Albany county in 1773 and called 
Tryon county until the close of the revolution. 
In 1790 there were several heads of families, 
according to the first federal census, in Mont- 
gomery county. In Mohawk we find Joseph 
Gordon with three males under sixteen and 
four females in his family ; Timothy Gordon, 
with three males under sixteen and four fe- 
males. Evidently they were of alj<3ut the same

Gordon lived at German Flats and William 
at Harpersfield, in the same county. An older 
man, James Gordon, was living in 1790 in 
Ballstown, Albany county, and had in his 
family four males over sixteen, two under six- 
teen and four females. Ezekiel Gordon, men- 
tioned below, was a son of James Gordon, and 
afterwards moved from Albany county to 
Montgomery county. James Gordon, also of 
Ballstown, had a family, and was the son of 
the James Gordon mentioned heretofore. Eze- 
kiel Gordon was born about 1773-80. He 
settled in Charleston Four Corners in what is 
now the town of Root, Montgomery county, 
and followed farming. It is more than likely 
that his family was Scotch-Irish coming with 
a flood of emigrants before the revolution to 
New England and New York. He was a 
member of the Christian church in later life, 
and a Whig in politics. Children: David, 
mentioned below ; James Schuyler and Peter. 

(II) David, son of Ezekiel Gordon, was

When a young man he engaged in the trade 
of cheese-making, and also learned the trade 
of miller in a grist mill at Browns Hollow. 
He then moved to the town of Carlisle. Scho- 
harie county, and followed the occupation of 
miller until shortly before his death, when he 
sold his mill and business and retired. He 
was interested in town affairs and held the 
office of commissioner of highways. He be- 
longed to the Christian church. In early life

The clan Armstrong was 
ARMSTRONG famed in Scotland for 
courage and patriotism. 
Scott, in the "Lay of the Last Minstrel," 
makes the chief say, when about to assemble 
the clans for some daring enterprise : 
"Ye need not go to Liddisdale, 
For when they see the blazing bale 
Elliots and Armstrongs never fail." 
The family tradition is that the name was 
originally bestowed upon a Highland chief for 
his great courage and physical powers. An- 
other and better authenticated tradition is that 
the name Armstrong is derived from the fol- 
lowing circumstance: "An ancient king of 
Scotland, having his horse killed under him 
in battle, was immediately remounted bv Fair- 
baim, his armor bearer, who took the king by 
the thigh and placed him in the saddle, al- 
thoiigh "heavily weighted by armor. For this 
timelv assistance and feat of strength, the king 
amply rewarded him with lands on the border ; 
gave him the name of Armstrong, and as- 
signed him for crest an armed hand and arm ; 
in the left hand a leg and foot in armor couped 
at the thigh all proper." 

(I I The emigrant ancestor of the Arni- 
strongs of Hudson, herein recorded, is Wil- 
liam, a descendant of the Scotch family that 
settled in the north of Ireland. He may have 
been connected with the .Armstrongs of Mas- 
sachusetts and Connecticut, but seems to be 
an independent branch in this country. Wil- 
liam came from Ireland and settled early in

York. He had several children who were 
grown up at the time of the revolution. The 
family tradition is that his wife was a descend- 
ant of Bishop Lattimore. 

(II) Benjamin, son of William Armstrong, 
was born about 1760. He settled in Albany 
county. New York, later becoming a farmer 
of the town of Duanesburg, Schenectady 
county, where he reared a family and died. 
He married and had William. 

(III) William (2), son of Benjamin Arm- 
strong, of Albany and Schenectady counties. 
New York, was born about 1770, died in New 
York City, early in the nineteenth century.

She was well educated in the public 
schools, and after her marriage to Mr. Daley 
began the study of law under his direction. 
She pursued a thorough, systematic course of 
study, and although not a member of the bar 
is well versed in legal lore, and is a wise and 
safe counsellor. Her ability is so well known 
that she was selected to prepare a digest of 
decisions of the United States supreme court 
and some fifty volumes were prepared under 
her able management, and bear her name. 
Her mental equipment is of the highest order, 
and in her husband's legal practice she is an 
active partner, stopping only at actual court- 
room presentation of the trial causes. She 
stands second to none in the county in her 
knowledge of the law and its skillful applica- 
tions. She is a daughter of Edward Lasher,

(The Lasher Line). 

The Lashers of Columbia county descend 
from Sebastian Loescher, who came to W'est 
Camp (Saugerties, Ulster county. New York)

Palatine, although there is no positive proof 
that he was either. I^Liny of the family be- 
lieve he was a descendant of Solomon La 
Chaire, of New York city, a lawyer, prac- 
ticing there from 1645 to 1662. Others claim 
that he was an elder brother of John Lasher, 
who came with him to this country, remaining 
in New York city, working at the cord- 
wainer's trade. The actual fact known is that 
he was at West Camp in 17 10, and that his

The Behan family of Albany 
BEHAX descend from an Irish ancestry 

seated in Adare, Ireland. The 
grandfather of Thomas Frederick Behan, the 
representative member of the present day 
family, was John Behan, born in Adare in 
1780; followed the occupation of a farmer; 
was a member of the Roman Catholic church ; 
married. 1804, Katherine Cullen, and had chil- 
dren : Thomas, of further mention ; James, 
born 1829; Katherine, 1831 ; Mary, 1833. 

(II) Thomas, eldest son of John and Kath- 
erine (Cullen) Behan, was born in Adare, Ire- 
land, August 15, 1827, died in Albany, New 
York, June 15, 1888. He began his business 
life as manager of a tobacco and snuff factory 
in Adare, continuing in that position until 
1850. when he came to the United States, lo- 
cating in Albany, New York. He again en- 
gaged in business as manager of the firm of 
Reed & Davis, one of the largest importing 
and wholesale wine and liquor houses in the 
state. In 1857 he resigned his position and 
established the same business under his own 
name, continuing until his death in 1888. He 
prospered exceedingly and in 1870 was rated 
one of Albany's wealthiest business men. Most 
of his fortune, however, was lost during the 
disastrous panic of 1872-73. He was a de- 
voted member of St. Mary's Roman Catholic 
Church and one of its greatest benefactors. 
When the new church edifice was erected in 
1867. he was the business adviser of the Rev. 
Clarence A. Walworth, the pa.stor, who relied 
implicitly on his judgment in matters regard- 
ing the financing of the building, a large under- 
taking in those days. In 1866-67 ^^' '" asso- 
ciation with the late Peter Cagger and Wil- 
liam Cassidy, acted as a committee in pur- 
chasing the property on the Troy road as a 
site for St. Agnes's cemetery, and was one 
of the original trustees of that corporation. 
He was a Democrat in politics and although 
tendered several local offices of importance by 
his party, steadfastly refused political prefer- 
ment. i-Ie possessed a large library of care- 
fully selected books and was a close student of 
the best in literature. He married, at Troy, 
New York, November 25, 1855, Winifred, 
born in Plattsburg, New York, .April i, 1831, 
daughter of James McManus. The McManus 
family came originally from the north of Ire- 
land. James McManus, born in the town of 
Boyle, 1797, a school teacher, later teller of 
the' Agricultural Bank of Boyle, emigrated to 
America in 1850 and settled in New York. 
His son, Thomas McManus, settled in Troy, 
New York, where he made a fortune in river 
transportation companies. During the civil 
war the steamers and barges owned by his 



companies were in the service of the govern- 
ment transporting men and supplies from 
northern ports to Fortress Monroe. He 
studied law and in 1871 was admitted to the 
bar, and became one of the leading lawyers of 
Troy, and held elective local office. He mar- 
ried, in 1867, Isabella Montague. Elizabeth 
McDermott, maternal grandmother of Thomas 
F. Behan, was born in 1796 in French Park, 
Ireland, daughter of Luke and Winifred (Mc- 
Dermott) McDermott (not related save by 
marriage). Thomas and Winifred Behan had 
children : Mary, Katherine, Winifred G., John 
v., Margaret, Emma R., Thomas F., of fur- 
ther mention, Joseph C, Jay W., all born in 
Albany, New York. 

(HI) Thomas Frederick, son of Thomas 
and Winifred (McManus) Behan, was born 
in Albany, New York, January 10, 1869. He 
was educated in public and private schools of 
that city. On completing his studies he en- 
tered the New York State Insurance Depart- 
ment at Albany as junior clerk. From his en- 
trance in 1883 until 1905 he passed through 
several grades of promotion until he reached 
the grade of chief clerk. In 1906 he was ap- 
pointed third deputy superintendent of insur- 
ance and served as such under the administra- 
tions of Otto H. Kelsey and William H. 
Hotchkiss, 1906-10. In 1906 Mr. Behan was 
admitted to the bar of the state, having pre- 
pared thoroughly and passed the necessary ex- 
amination. He is a Democrat in politics ; 
member of Cathedral of the Immaculate Con- 
ception. His club is the Albany, which he 
joined in 1897. In 1904 he was elected to the 
board of governors, serving 1904-05-06. He 
is unmarried.

assistant. After the death of the latter, the 
son continued the operation of the farm and

lector of the school district four years, and 
since 1907 has been supervisor, being elected

The branch of the Brown fam- 
BROWN ily herein recorded traces its 
origin to the year 1538. when 
Henry VHL gave to Sir .Anthony Brown, 
Knight, divers manors in Sussex and the 
priory of St. Mary Overy in Southwark. He 
died in 1568. His eldest son. Anthony, who 
was created Viscount Montague in 1554, died 
before his father, in 1562, leaving children by 
two wives. By his first wife, Jane, daughter 
of the Earl of Sussex, he had one son, .An- 
thony, who succeeded his father to the title 
of viscount, and later to his grandfather's 
manors and priory, died in 1592 without leav- 
ing legal heirs, and the estate and title then 
passed to the children of his father by his 
second marriage with Margaret, daughter of 
Lord Dacre. Although there were several 
sons by this marriage, strange to say none 
ever appeared to claim the estate and title, and 
all attempts to trace them in England signally 
failed. 

It is believed in England that the heirs 
of the two younger sons, George and William, 
emigrated to America about the year 1680, and 



that the heir of the latter, William Brown, 
settled in Pennsylvania. 

(I) The first Brown of record to settle in 
the state of New York was Henry Brown, one 
of the first settlers, who purchased a tract of 
land, part of which was in Mapletown. but on 
account of threats of the Tories, who had 
their ammunition near the White House 
bridge, and after the burning of his house, he 
changed his place of residence to Albany, ac- 
companied by all his family with the excep- 
tion of Nathaniel. He was the father of sev- 
eral sons and daughters, among whom was 
Nathaniel, see forward, Nicholas, Peter. In 
the documentary history of New York there is 
record of a grant of land to Henry Brown's 
wife that was confiscated. She was related to 
the late President Rutherford B. Hayes. 

(II) Nathaniel, son of Henry Brown, was 
born in Hoosick, New York. He was a farmer 
and large land owner, possessing four farms, 
on one of which were fine quarries of slate, 
which he opened and operated ; these quarries 
were on the road leading from Hoosick vil- 
lage to Hoosick Falls and were considered of 
great importance. He was a member of the 
Baptist church and otherwise prominent in the 
town. He married Margaret, daughter of 
Nicholas and Margaret Powers, who came 
from Livingston Alanor to Hoosick, one of 
the first settlers, whose farm joined that of 
Henry Brown. Children of Mr. and Mrs. 
Powers: Eve. born December 6, 1773; Cath-

This family descends from 
POWELL Thomas Powell, of Wales, 

Great Britain, who was one of 
the purchasers and patentees of Huntington, 
Long Island, in 1664. He was a man of 



means and of prominence. He purchased. Au- 
gust 18, 1695, from "Mawmee, alias Sere- 
wanus, William Chepy and all ye rest of ye 
Indian proprietors" for and in consideration of 
one hundred and forty pounds, the tract land 
on which the village of Bethpage is now situ- 
ated. Patents were issued for these pur- 
chases by Governor Dongan to Thomas Powell 
in 1664 and in 1695. The latter purchase be- 
came the family seat, Thomas (2) settling 
thereon the same year. 

(I) Thomas Powell was born in Wales, 
Great Britain, August, 1641, died at West- 
bury, Long Island, December 28, 1721. Hun- 
tington records show that he was frequently 
elected to fill important positions in the town- 
ship, the first of which appears to have been 
in 1663, when at the age of twenty-two he 
was made recorder, which office he held for 
about twenty years; in 1667 he was constable. 
"Every constable shall have a staff six feet 
long with the king's arms on it, as a badge of 
his authority." He was appointed surveyor,, 
in 1679, to lay out land in the East Riding, 
and overseer in 1672. He was again chosen 
constable in 1682, but refused to serve, being 
"scrupulous of swearing as the law directs." 
The constable had to swear to levy and collect 
the church rates. After the year 16S8, at 
which tiine he was surveyor, he was more en- 
gaged with appointments in Friends Meetings 
than public business. He attended the month- 
ly meetings which were held alternately at 
Jericho and W'estbury. The last mention of 
his name on the records was in this wise: 
"28-i2mo. 172 1 died Thomas Powell Senr., 
being well respected as a worthy Friend, and 
died in Unity with Friends." His first wife 
was unknown. Children: i. Thomas, of fur-

(II) Thomas (2), son of Thomas (i) 
Powell, was born in Wales, Great Britain, died 
at Dethpage, Long Island, September 27, 1731. 
His home was the first white man's house built 
in that vicinity, although there were many 
Indian wigwams in the neighborhood. In 
1727 Friends Meetings were held once a 
month, in first days, at his house, and in 1744 
a meeting house was built. In his will he left 
his son Thomas four acres of land and the 
house that stands upon it — "My father's home- 
stead," more than any other of the sons. He

HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



The American ancestor of this 

FOSTER branch of the Foster family 
came to this country from Exe- 
ter, Devonshire, England. He brought with 
him his wife Judith, five sons and two daugh- 
ters. He settled in Ipswich, Massachusetts, 
about 1638, being one of the earliest settlers 
of the town. His descendants are many, and 
are to be found in every state in the Union. 

( I ) Asa Fitch Foster, the first of the line 
herein recorded, married and had a son, John 
Newton, see forward. 

(H) John Newton, son of Asa Fitch Foster, 
was born in Utica, New York, June 28, 1836. 
He lost both parents while he was yet an in- 
fant, and the persons who reared him re- 
moved to Albany, New York, in 1836. He 
received his education in the Albany public 
schools, and on arriving at a suitable age was 
apprenticed to Lawson Annesley, who taught 
him the gilding trade. He later formed a 
partnership, and as Chapin & Foster was en- 
gaged in business in Albany, dealing in gilders' 
materials, pictures and frames. In 1873 he 
first connected with the fire insurance busi- 
ness patrol of Albany, and was appointed 
superintendent. Fie was prominent in public 
life, and held important public office. In 1878 
he was elected to the state legislature and 
made a good record. For two years he was 
superintendent of the poor for Albany county, 
and during the panic years following 1872 
was in charge of the relief store maintained in 
Albany. He married Mary A. Snyder, who 
bore him six children. He died x'\pril 13, 
1895. 

(Ill) Henry S., son of John Newton and 
Mary A. (Snyder) Foster, was born in Al- 
l>any, New York, July 16, 1865. He attended 
the public schools until he reached the age 
(if fifteen years, and then became a clerk in 
the office of the Mutual Fire Insurance Com- 
pany of Albany (incorporated 1836). His en- 
tire business life has been spent in the service 
of this company, and to no one man should 
more credit be given for the high standing of 
this company. He has been successively book- 
keeper, cashier, and in November, 1893, suc- 
ceeded George Cuyler as secretary and gen- 
eral manager, the office becoming vacant by 
death. This is one feature only of Mr. Fos- 
ter's activity. He maintains close relations 
with many of the leading home and foreign 
insurance companies, representing them in all 
lines, life, fire and accident. His business is a 
large one, and is thoroughly systematized and 
ai)ly managed. He is also a director in other 
associations, and connected with various busi- 
ness interests. He is a member of Temple 
Lodge, No. 14, Free and Accepted Masons, of 



Albany. He is prominently connected with the 
Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and was 
an officer of the Grand Lodge. He is a mem- 
ber of the Albany Club and numerous associa- 
tions, and politically a Republican.

The English ancestry of the 
HARTT Hartt family of America is un- 
questioned but difiicult to un- 
ravel. I-'rom the will of William Harte of 
the parisii of St. Thomas the Apostle. Lon- 
don, England, proved in 1632, it is learned 
he had three sons, William. Richard and 
Thomas Hartt. (He wrote his name Harte, 
but the will gives the sons' names as Hartt.) 
Three of the name, Samuel Hartt, John Harte 
and Nicholas Hart, came from London, Eng- 
land, to America between 1631 and 1642. and 
may have been sons of one or each of these 
three sons of William, as they are believed to 
have been brothers or cousins. Samuel Hartt 
in 1653 called himself thirty-one years of age 
and said he was sent over from England to 
the Iron Works at Lynn. Massachusetts, in 
1640. He married Mary How, a widow, and 
is the progenitor of the New Hampshire 
branch. Nicholas Hart, supposed son of 
Richard of London. England, was the progen-

itor of the Dutchess county, New York, 
branch from whom Arthur Hartt, of Ravena, 
New York, descends, spelled his name Hart. 
Where or when the tt came into use does not 
appear, probably this was at first a local spell- 
ing, as is Harte. Nicholas was of Taunton, 
Massachusetts, 1642; in 1643 was of Boston, 
remaining there until 1648, then settling at 
Warwick. Rhode Island, where he was a mer- 
chant. He served in the colonial wars of 
1643 as a soldier in Captain William Pool's 
company. He married Joanna, youngest 
daughter of Edward Rossiter, of Rhode 
Island, who came from London, England, 
with and was assistant to Governor John Win- 
throp, of Massachusetts. There are no rec- 
ords of the death of Nicholas Hart or his 
wife. Austin's "Genealogical Dictionary" 
says they left one son only. 

(II) Richard, only son of Nicholas and 
Joanna (Rossiter) Hart, was born in Eng- 
land about 1635 ; came to America with his 
father and lived at Portsmouth, Rhode Island. 
He was a sailor and lost his life at sea, near 
Boston harbor, in January, 1695. The last 
vessel he sailed on was the sloop "Dragon," 
Captain Robert Glover. He had a grant of 
eight acres in Portsmouth in 1657, half of 
which he sold in 1662. He married Hannah 
Keen. Children born in Portsmouth, Rhode

lived at Little Compton. Rhode Island, near 
the Tiverton line. Tradition says his wife 
Amy long outlived him. There was a path 
on his farm to five graves of Hartt families, 
with plain granite gravestones that was called 
"Amy Hartt's Path," so worn was it by her 
frequent visits to the graves. He married

(\') Richard (4), son of Captain Ricliard' 
(3) and Mary (Taber) Hartt, was born in 
Little Compton, Rhode Island. About 1760 
he settled in Dutchess county, New York, and 
bought a large farm on the "turnpike," leading 
from Poughkeepsie to Sharon, Connecticut. 
Here he built a large stone house about fif- 
teen miles east of Poughkeepsie, which was- 
later occupied by his brother Philip and is 
still standing. About 1767 he executed sev- 
eral deeds signed by himself and wife Ruth. 
He styled himself a "clothier." He afterward' 
removed to Albany, New York, where on 
January 7, 1783. he deeded his interest in the 
farm to his brother Philip. On September 18, 
1793, Abigail Hartt, widow of Richard Hartt, 
of Little Compton, Rhode Island, deerled her 
right to the same I'hili]:) Hartt. making him' 
exclusive owner of the Dutchess county farm. 
Soon after 1770 a large population from Dart- 
mouth. Massachusetts, settled at this point,, 
among them several Hart families, and it be- 
came known as Hart Village, now Mill- 
brook. Richard Hartt marriecl (first) at Tiv-

The name Den or Dene, which is 
DKAXE the ancient way of spelling what 

is now- written Deane, makes its 
appearance in England .soon after the intro- 
duction of surnames. John and Walter Deane, 
w-ho are the progenitors of many of those now 
bearing the name Deane and Dean in the 
United States, came to this country about 
1637. .After stopping in Boston a year they 
settled at Taunton, Massachusetts. It has 
been a tradition in the family that John and 
Walter Deane came from Taunton, England, 
but an authority states they w-ere from Chard 
near Taunton. Another tradition is that a 
younger brother of theirs came to this country 
after them and settled in Connecticut, and" 
that from him, Hon. Silas Deane, of Connecti- 
cut, descended. (This is the line of the Deanes 
of Catskill. New York). There was a Thomas 
Deane in Connecticut in 1643 who possibly 
may have been the brother referred to. (See 
"Hinman's First Puritan Settlers," p. 21). 
The earliest ancestor of Hon. Silas Deane, 
who is probably the most prominent public 
character of the Deane family, is his great- 
grandfather, James Deane, of Stonington, 
Connecticut, who may have been a son of 
Thomas Deane, the emigrant, 1643, to whom 
Hinman refers. There is. however, abundant 
evidence that James Deane, of Stonington,. 
was a son of Walter Deane. of Taunton, Mas- 
sachusetts. This evidence is so convincing 
that Arthur D. Dean, compiler of a history of 



1696 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



tlie descendants of Ezra Dean, of Plainfield, 
Connecticut, so places him in that work. 

(I) Walter Deane was born in Qiard, Eng- 
land, between 1615 and 1620. He took the 
freeman's oath in Massachusetts, December 
4, 1638. He settled in Taunton, Massachu- 
setts, was deputy 1640, and selectman of Taun- 
ton 1679-86. He was by trade a farmer. He 
married Eleanor, daughter of Richard Strong, 
of Taunton, England. Children: Joseph, 
Ezra, Benjamin, James, perhaps two others. 

(II) James, son of Walter and Eleanor 
(Strong) Deane, was a blacksmith and iron 
worker at Taunton, later of Scituate, Massa- 
chusetts. February 26, 1676, the town of 
Stonington. Connecticut, at a town meeting 
voted to donate a home lot of twenty-four 
acres of land to James Deane to induce him 
to settle there and follow his trade of black- 
smith. One hundred acres of farm land was 
also included in the offer. He accepted and 
followed his trade in Stonington until 1698, 
when he removed to Plainfield, Connecticut. 
There he was elected the first town clerk in 
1699, filling that office many years. He was 
a large land owner in Plainfield and in Volun- 
tovvn" He died at Plainfield, May 29, 1725, 
Tiis wife, April 26, 1726. Children: James, 
born October 31, 1674; Sarah, September 4, 
1676; John, of further mention; Onecephorus 
(twin), died in infancy; Mary (twin), born 
March 28, 1680, married Thomas Thatcher; 
Francis, September 8, 1682; William, died 
young; Hannah, baptized April 4, 1686; Wil- 
liam, born September 12, 1689; Nathaniel, 
baptized .\pril 2, 1693, married Joanna Fish- 
er; Jonathan, baptized April 22, 1695, married 
Sarah Douglas. 

(III) John, son of James Deane. of Ston- 
ington and Plainfield, Connecticut, was born 
May 15, 1678. He married Lydia Thatcher, 
June 10, 1708. 

(IV) Silas, son of John and Lydia (Thatch- 
er) Deane, married, and among his children 
was Silas. 

(V) Hon. Silas (2), son of Silas (i) 
Deane, was born at Groton, Connecticut, De- 
■cember 24. 1737, died at Deal, England, .\n- 
^ust 23, 1789. He was graduated with high 
honors at Yale College in 1758, when twenty- 
one years of age. He entered public life, was 
an ardent patriot and skillful diplomat. He 
took a prominent part in equipping naval 
forces, and was elected a memljer of the first 
continental congress in 1774 and was regarded 
as an able member. He was sent by congress 
to France as political and financial agent of 
ihe government. He arrived at Paris in June, 

1776, with instructions to ascertain the temper 
of the French government concerning the rup- 



ture with Great Britain, and to obtain military 
support and supplies. When in September 
it was determined to send ministers to negoti- 
ate treaties, Franklin and Arthur Lee were 
commissioned to join him in Paris. He assist- 
ed them in the negotiation of the important 
treaties with France, and enlisted the sympa- 
thies of Lafayette. In consequence of the ex- 
travagant contracts he had entered into, not 
authorized by his instructions, he was re- 
called November 21, 1777, John Adams be- 
ing appointed in his place. He left Paris, 
April I, 1778, and returned to America. On 
his return he was called before congress and 
required to give an account of his contracts 
with foreign officers and to make a detailed 
statement of financial transactions on the floor 
of the house. He evaded a complete explana- 
tion and disclosure of his accounts on the 
ground that his papers were in Europe. He 
memorialized congress, but did not succeed in 
removing the suspicion from himself of hav- 
ing overstepped his authority and of having 
misappropriated the public money. He re- 
turned to France, but the French government 
declining to receive him he went to Holland, 
where he spent his entire private fortune in 
procuring proofs and in preparing an address 
backed by irrefutable evidence that none of 
the public money had been appropriated to his 
own use. This was published in 1784, but 
he had so bitterly attacked congress and his 
fellow commissioners, for the suspicion they 
had thrown around him. that they refused him 
justice and would do nothing to right the wrong 
they had done him. He had said he would 
vindicate himself if it took every dollar and 
it did. He returned to England, where he 
died in poverty. He was the soul of honor, 
as is shown by the testimonials from his neigh- 
bors and acquaintances. Says the historian, 
Hildreth : "No proof appears that he had been 
dishonest, or had employed the public money 
in speculations of his own, but he had occupied 
the unfortunate position of having large sums 
of public money pass through his hands be- 
fore any proper system of vouchers and ac- 
cotmting had been established, and he fell be- 
fore the same spirit of malignant accusation 
which presently assaulted Wadsworth, Greene, 
Morris, and even Franklin himself, but which 
they had better means of warding off." In 
1842 congress at last adjusted Deane's ac- 
counts and paid to his heirs about $37,000. 
Yale College conferred tlie degree of A. M. in 
1763. He is the author of "Paris Papers, or 
Mr. Silas Deane's late intercepted letters to 
his brother and other friends (1751) and pub- 
lished in his own defence" ; ".An address to 
the Free and Independent Citizens of the

United States of North America" (1784). He 
married and liad issue. 

( \'I ) Zephaniah, son of Hon. Silas (2) 
Deane, settled first in Pennsylvania, where he 
owned a large farm of four hundred acres. 
This he sold to a syndicate who later opened 
upon it one of tlie first coal mines. Other 
members of his wife's family (.'^^bbott). hold- 
ing smaller areas of land, leased their coal 
lands on a royalty that made them very 
wealthy. After selling his Pennsylvania lands 
he settled in New York on the shores of Lake 
Skancateles on a farm, now the site of a large 
jiapermaking plant. He later settled in Cox- 
sackie. Greene county. New York, and still 
later in Connecticut, where he died. He mar- 
ried Catherine Abbott, of Brooklyn, New 
York. They had sons, Zephaniah and Silas. 

(VH) Silas (3), son of Zephaniah and 
Catherine (Abbott) Deane, was born July 24, 
179S, died at Athens, Greene county. New 
York, August 24, 1849, from Asiatic cholera. 
He was a carpenter and contractor, and set- 
tled in Coxsackie, New York. Pie was the 
first "square rule" carpenter in Greene county. 
He made the screw hay presses that were used 
in this country. He traveled south in the 
winter time and erected sugar giims and other

The Wood family now seated in 
WOOD Chatham, New York, are of old 
Massachusetts ancestry. Through 
intermarriages they are related to many noted 
New England families, and themselves were 
of more than local celebrity. One branch in- 
termarried with the Quaker family of South- 
wick that suffered much persecution at the 
hands of Massachusetts authorities. The di- 
rect ancestors were whipped, imprisoned, and 
finally banished and their property confiscated, 
their sole offence being that they dared wor- 
ship God in a manner not dictated by Massa- 
chusetts statutes. The Rice and Taft families 
are also Wood connections. In the revolution, 
Ezra Wood and Captain Josiah Wood, both 
descendants of Thomas Wood, the founder, 
gave patriotic service. This particular 
branch inclines to the professions, and a num- 
ber of ministers, physicians, lawyers and pro- 
fessors, are found in several of the genera- 
tions. The family appears in New York after 
the revolution, Wheelock Wood being the 
first of his line permanently to settle in Herki- 
mer county, New York. 

(I) Thomas Wood, of Rowley. Massachu- 
setts, is supposed to be the first of this branch 
in this country. His ancestors have not been 
discovered, although there is some reason to 
believe he belonged to the Wood family of 
Norwich, Norfolk county, England. In 1763 
Colonel Eliphalct Dyer visited England and 
brought back for Annie (Wood) Elderkin, 
wife of Colonel Jedediah Elderkin. and 
daughter of Thomas, son of Thomas Wood, 
of Rowley, a crest and coat of arms, supposed 
to be those of the Wood family to which she 
belonged, the Woods of Norwich. The first 
known of Thomas Wood is his marriage re- 
corded in Rowley. Thomas and Ann Wood 
were married 4 months, 7 days, 1654. His 
wife was Ann Hunt, of Ipswich, Massachu- 
setts. Rowley records show him to have been 
a man of excellent Christian character and of 
high standing among his townsmen. He was 
buried September 12, 1687. Children: i. 
Mary, born March 15, 1655, supposed to have 
been the Mary Wood who married Edward 
Ordway. 2. John, born November 2, 1656; 
settled in Bradford, Massachusetts, then in 
Littleton ; married Isabel Hazen. 3. Thomas, 
born August 10, 1658; married Mary Hunt. 
4. Ann, born August 8, 1660; married Benja- 
min Plummer. 5. Ruth, born July 21, 1662; 
married (first) Captain Joseph Jewett, (sec- 
ond) Jdhii Lunt or Hunt. 6. Josiah, born 



September 5, 1664; married Mary Felt. 7. 
Elizabeth, twin of Josiah, married Captain 
Joseph Boynton. 8. Samuel, born December 
26, 1666; married Margaret Ellithorpe. 9. Sol- 
omon, born Alay 17, 1669; married ^lary 
Hazeltine. 10. Ebenezer, of further mention. 
II. James, died at age of twenty years. 

(II) Ebenezer, tenth child and sixth son of 
Thomas and Ann (Hunt) Wood, was born in 
Rowley, Massachusetts, December 29, 1671, 
baptized in the First Church, December 31, 
1671. He lived in Rowley until July 14, 1717, 
when he and wife were dismissed to the Alen- 
don Church. He married, April 5, 1695, 
Ruth Nichols. Children born in Rowley: i. 
James, born April 28, 1696. 2. Ebenezer, De- 
cember 6, 1698. 3. Jonathan, of further men- 
tion. 4. David, Rlay 30, 1704. 5. Samuel, 
May 21, 1706. 6. Jesse, March 2, 1709. 7. 
Moses, April 3, 17 12. 8. Eliphalet, baptized 
August 15, 1714. 

(III) Jonathan, third son of Ebenezer and 
Ruth (Nichols) Wood, was baptized in the 
First Church at Rowley, Jilassachusetts, No- 
vember 2, 1701, by Rev. Edward Payson,^ 
the fourth settled pastor of that church. He 
married Hannah Dresser and had issue, in- 
cluding sons Jonathan and Josiah. 

(IV) Captain Josiah Wood, son of Jona- 
than and Hannah (Dresser) Wood, was born 
in Mendon, died November 3, 1815. He lived 
on the Lake Faron place in Northbridge. Mas- 
sachusetts, and was said to be a Universalist. 
This may be true, as in the Orthodox church 
records the names of Josiah Wood and Tip- 
porah Wood appear as uniting with the church 
in 1765, by confession, also that she was ex- 
pelled, August 24, 1802, and he, November 26, 
1809 (revolutionary record). Josiah Wood 
appears with the rank of captain on Lexington 
alarm roll of Captain Josiah Wood's com- 
pany which marched on the alarm of April 19, 
1775, from Northbridge to Roxbury. Length 
of service, ten days. Town to which each sol- 
dier belonged, Northbridge. (Vol. 13, p. 
163). Josiah Wood appears among a list of 
officers dated July 9, 1776, chosen by the sev- 
eral companies in Colonel Ezra Wood's 
(Third Worcester Company) regiment. Rank, 
captain, Seventh Company. Reported com- 
missioned, July 9, 1776. (Vols. 43 & 28, pps. 
222 & 119). Josiah Wood appears among a 
list of officers appointed to command men 
listed in or drafted from (Worcester Com- 
pany) brigade, as returned to Major General 
Warren (year not given). Rank, captain, of 
a company drafted from Colonel Ezra Wood's 
regiment, company to join Colonel Josiah 
Whitney's or Colonel Nathan Sparhawk's 
regiment, residence. Northbridge. (Vol. 1.2).

This is a genuine German sur- 
DRCKER name. Decher. as the name is 

frequently spelled, re]3rcsents 
in German the number ten. and was ajiiilied 
to the tenth child. Some assume, however, 
that the family name was derived from the 
occupation of a decker — one who builds or 
lays the decks of vessels. The name is com- 
mon in Germany and in the United States. 
The family is found in Holland, whither it is 
believed they fled to escape religious persecu- 
tion. The name is first found in New Eng- 
land in 1^)72. when John Decker was a resi- 
dent of l-'xeter. The name is found at a still 
earlier date in the early records of Staten 
Island, where Johannes De Decker arrived in 
.\pril. i('/)3. The family became very nuiuer- 
ous on Staten Island, frequent intermarriage 
making ibe tracing of their genealogy exceed- 
ingly difficult. Johannes De Decker was a 
])rominent man in the colony, filling various 
offices of responsibility, and after a public 
service of several years retired for the re- 
mainder of his days to his farm of one hun- 
dred and twenty acres on .Staten Island.

is descended begins with Ian I'.nKTsin Decker,

Curtis N. Douglas, son of 
DOUGLAS John Pettit and Henrietta 
(Hughson) Douglas, was born 
at Watertown, New York, May 28, 1856. He 
attended Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytech- 
nic Institute from 1864 to 1870, and John C. 
Overheisus Classical School from 187 1 to 1873. 
He then entered the University of Roch- 
ester, from which he was graduated, class 
of 1877, with the degree of A.B. He at once 
began an active business life ; from 1877 to 
1880 he was secretary and assistant to his 
father, the most extensive land owner in Jef- 
ferson county, New York. He assisted in the 
management of farms, stock breeding and 
lumber operations, all of which were of large 
proportions requiring expert knowledge and 
careful supervision. But his tastes were not 
satisfied by a business life, being inclined 
towards a literary or professional career. 
From January until June, 1881, he was head 
master of Betts Academy at Stamford, Con- 
necticut, and from there went to J. H. Massis 
College Preparatory School in New York, 
where he was assistant master. From 1882 
to 1886 he conducted a college preparatory 
school of his own. In 1886 he returned to 
commercial life and since that date he has been 
genetal manager of L. Thomson & Company, 
wholesale lumber merchants of Albany, New 
York. He has always taken a lively interest 
in public affairs. In 1894 he represented the 
tenth assembly district of Albany in the state 
legislature, and in 1899-1900 w-as state sena- 
tor from Albany county. He is an ex-presi- 
dent of the Young Men's Christian Associa- 
tion of Albany. He married, June 24, 1886, 
Nancy Sherman, daughter of Lemon Thom- 
son, of Albany, and granddaughter of Au- 
gustus Sherman, of Glens Falls, New York. 
(See Thomson IV). Mr. and Mrs. Douglas 
have three children: Kenneth Thomson, Dor- 
othea and Gertrude Thomson. 

(The Thomson Line). 
Douglas and Thomson is a blending of 
Scotch-Irish blood that has produced, as it 
always does, men and women of high charac- 
ter and strong physical as w-ell as mental at- 
tributes. The name of Thomson is common to 
England, Scotland and Ireland, differing only 
in the addition or omission of the letter P. 
Douglas is the name of an ancient Scottish 
clan whose history has been told in story and 
song for centuries. Both families have pro- 
duced men of note in the political, military, lit- 



erary, professional and business life of the 
United States. New Jersey was the home of 
John Thomson, shot and scalped by Indians, 
and his wife, Juda, who drew her little son 
John two hundred and fifty miles over the 
mountains of Pennsylvania after the killing 
of her husband. They were the grandparents 
of Judge Thomson, of Hunterdon county, 
New Jersey. 

(I) Benjamin Thomson, American ancestor 
of this branch of the Thomson family, was 
born in the north of Ireland, died at Eliza- 
beth, New Jersey. The date of his emigra- 
tion and settlement in New Jersey is not def- 
inite. He was a magistrate under the Crown, 
and a man of importance and means, as his 
son received a college education. His wife 
came from Scotland. They were both mem- 
bers of the Presbyterian church. 

(II) Charles, son of Benjamin Thomson, 
was of Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was a 
graduate of Princeton College, and during the 
war of the revolution went to England, where 
he married the widow of an Episcopal minis- 
ter. He returned to America, where he died, 
leaving two sons. 

(HI) Charles C, son of Charles Thomson, 
was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, July 8, 
1788, died in Johnsonburg, New York, March 
I, i860. He married, about 1819, Susanna 
Harris Williams, a daughter of Joseph Wil- 
liams, a soldier of the revolution, who was 
wounded in battle and received a pension. 
Their children were Lemon, see forward ; Ed- 
ward, married Maria Morehouse; William; 
Susan, married John Wakely. 

(I\') Lemon, son of Charles C. Thomson, 
was born in Athol, Warren county, New 
York, January 22, 1822. He was educated in 
the public schools, and at the age of seven- 
teen began teaching, and when twenty-one was 
elected county superintendent of schools. He 
prepared for college at Glens Falls Academy, 
and at the age of twenty-five entered the soph- 
omore class at Union College, graduating in 
1850. After leaving college he read law with 
Judge Rosekrans, but never practiced, prefer- 
ing a commercial career. In 1855 he removed 
to .Albany, where he formed a partnership 
w ith Iiis father-in-law, Augustus Sherman, un- 
der the firm name of L. Thomson & Com- 
pany. The firm owned large tracts of timber 
in Northern New York, and dealt extensively 
in manufactured lumber. He was a very ener- 
getic, capable business man and ranked among 
the leading successful merchants and bank- 
ers of Albany. His religious connection was 
with Emmanuel Baptist Church, of which he 
was an active member and liberal supporter. 
In politics he w^as originally a Democrat, but

•when slavery became the issue joined the Re- 
jnibhcan party. He was a frequent contrib- 
ut(jr to the papers and periodicals of his day. 
His articles, mostly on local or political sub- 
jects, were both pleasing and logical, display- 
ing a broadness of vision and deep familiarity 
witli the topics he was discussing. He served 
the city of Albany as alderman from 1864 to 
1867. In councils he was an early advocate 
of reform and economy in the administration 
of city business. In 1882 he was a candi- 
date for congress on the Citizens' ticket. In 
the board of trade, in business associations 
and party conventions he w-as active and pro- 
gressive, always advocating measures tending 
to the public good. 

Mr. Thomson married, June 25, 185 1, Abby 
G.. died February 24, 1907, daughter of Au- 
gustus Sherman, of Glens Falls, New York, 
a descendant of Roger Sherman, a signer of 
tlie Declaration of Independence. Their chil- 
dren were: i. Burke, who died in infancy. 
2. Hattie Darling, who died in childhood. 3. 
Gertrude .-Vlden, w^ho became the wife of John 
A. Dix. 4. Nancy Sherman, wife of Curtis N. 
Douglas, mentioned above. 



The early Gardners of Dutch- 
G.KRDNER ess and Orange counties, 
New York, were descendants 
of Benoni Gardiner, of Rhode Island, died 
1 73 1. The record is not clear, but the prev- 
alence of the names Stephen and Nathaniel in 
the family of Benoni and other facts taken in 
consideration lead to the conclusion that Be- 
noni Gardiner w^as the eldest son of George 
Gardiner, died 1677, who was admitted an in- 
habitant of the Island of Aquidneck (New- 
port, Rhode Island), 1638. In 1642 was con- 
stable and senior sergeant: 1644 was ensign. 
His first wife was Herodias Hicks^^^ His sec- 
ond wife, Lydia Rallou. died G??^ By both 

wives he had fourteen childrenT 

(II) Benoni, eldest child of George and 
Herodias (Hicks) Gardiner, died 1731. By 
one record he is said to have been one hun- 
dred years of age, which is evidently errone- 
ous, as he took the oath of allegiance. May 
19, 1671. being then probably just come of 
age. In 1727 he calls Iiimself ninety years of 
age, which is also improbable. In 1679 he and 
forty-one others of Narragansett signed a pe- 
tition to the King praying that he would "put 
an end to the difference about the government 
thereof, which has been so fatal to the pros- 
jjerity of the place." He owned land at Kings- 
town, Rhode Island, as several deeds testify. 
His wife, Mary, born 1645. <iied November 
16. 1729, bore him sons, William, Xatlianiel, 
Stephen. Isaac, and a daughter, Bridget. 



(Ill) Stephen, son of Benoni and Mary 
Gardiner, was born 1685. There is no record 
of his marriage, but the records show that his 
father deeded him a dwelling house and or- 
chard. His father was considerably over 
ninety years of age at death : his Uncle Henry 
nearly if not quite one hundred years old; the 
supposition is that Stephen married late in 
life and that Nathaniel is his son, Stephen be- 
ing then fifty-four years of age. 

(I\') Nathaniel, son of Stephen Gardiner, 
was born March 17, 1739. He settled in the 
town of Washington, Dutchess county. New 
York, where the name becomes Gardner, and 
is so used by his descendants. .A deed dated 
April 4, 1792, given by John Thorn, of New 
Windsor. Ulster county, New York, "Gent." 
of the one part and Nathaniel Gardner of the 
town of Washington, Dutchess county. New 
York, "yeoman" witnesses the transfer of 
property to the latter from the former, con- 
sideration five hundred pounds. The land ad- 
joined other lands of Gardner 1 in the town of 
Washington. The deed was recorded May 9, 
1792. and bears the signature of Robert H. 
Livingston. He married Eunice Sunderland, 
born October 28, 1738, and had issue. 

(\') Stephen (2), son of Nathaniel and 
Eunice (Sunderland) Gardner, was born in 
the village of Millbrook, Dutchess county, 
New York, February 27, 1767. He was a life- 
long resident and farmer of that section. He 
married, June 14, 1792, Mary Goodrich, born 
^farch 2. 1777. Children: i. Louis born May 
26, 1793. 2. Elizabeth, baptized .April 6. 1795, 
married Isaac Wilsey, died June 25, 1873. 3. 
Dorcas, born December 18, 1798. married 
Peter \'an .Alstyne. born 1802. died 1S71 : 
she died December 18. 1869. 4. Cynthia, 
born May 2, 1800: married James Muler. 5. 
Jefferson, of furtlier mention. 6. Melissa, 
born November 22, 1804: married Alexander 
McCoyd, died June 14, 1872: she died Novem- 
ber 13, 1894. 7. James Harvey, born June 19, 
1810. died October 11, 1849: married Ann 
Hanks. 

(\T) Jefferson, son of Stephen (2) and 
Mary (Goodrich) Gardner, was born .April 17, 
1802. in Dutchess county. New York, died in 
Troy, June 2, 1888. He settled in Troy when 
a young man and was ever after a resident 
of that city and one of the pioneers in collar 
manufacturing. Among other early collar 
makers of Troy was John W. White, wiio in 

1839 was in business at 345 River street. In 

1840 Jefferson Gardner became his partner. 
The following year the firm dissolved and Mr. 
Gardner removed to 42 King street, and con- 
tinued in the same business. In 1851-52 Na- 
thaniel Wheeler, of the firm of Wheeler, Wil- 



son & Company, visited Troy for the purpose 
of having his newly invented sewing machine 
adopted by the collar makers. Alluding to the 
results of his visit, Mr. Wheeler said: "I par- 
ticularly brought the attention of the manufac- 
turers of collars and cuffs to the machine, 
most of whom shook their heads, doubting the 
practicability of stitching collars by machin- 
ery. Among my visitors was Jefferson Gard- 
ner, who seemed to be less skeptical, patiently 
investigated the subject and concluded to give 
the machine a trial." Early in 1852 several 
machines were sent to Air. Gardner, who put 
them in practical operation in his factory. His 
tests were so satisfactory that he soon ordered 
more machines. This first introduction of sew- 
ing machines to collar making is due to Mr. 
Gardner's willingness to follow modern in- 
vention, and his application of the sewing ma- 
chine to his business gave to collar manufac- 
turing a new life that resulted in its mar- 
velous growth. He married Mary Ann 
Wright, born in Troy, New York, September 
2, 1807, died there May 27, 1892, daughter 
of John Wright, born at Inglesby Cross, York- 
shire, England, March 12, 1770, died in Troy, 
September 24. 1823 ; married Hannah Daw- 
son, born in England, Christmas, 1768, died 
in Lansingburg (Troy), February 21, 1867, at 
the great age of ninety-nine years, having 
lived in the United States since 1804. Jeffer- 
son and Mary Ann (Wright) Gardner had 
twelve children, seven of whom are living 
and eight of whom are given: i. Hannah, 
married William Earl, of the famous Earl & 
Wilson collar firm. 2. Mary Jane, of further

Rufus Hall, grandfather of Anna Ann 
(Hall) Durham, was born in Exeter, Rhode 
Island, June 19, 1747, son of Samuel and 
Dinah Hall, who were members of the So- 
ciety of Friends. He appeared in the public 
ministry' in the twenty-sixth year of his age ; 
in 1775 he removed to Easton, New York, and 
in 1804 removed to Northampton, where he 
died May 26, 1818, aged seventy years. He 
married Anna Hoxie, and they were the par- 
ents of Richard Hall, father of Anna Ann 
(Hall) Durham. Richard Hall was born No-

(IV) Richard, son of Durfee and Anna 
Ann (Hall) Durham, was born May 6. 1838, 
at Easton, Washington county. New York, 
died December 9, 1901. He enlisted in Com- 
pany A, One Hundred and Twenty-third Reg- 
iment, New York State Volunteers, from 
Greenwich and Easton. This regiment was 
enlisted in Washington county, New York, 
in August, 1862, mustered into the United 
States service. September 4, 1862, joined the 
Army of the Potomac. It was engaged in 
the battles of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg 
in May and July, 1863: was transferred to 
the Army of the Cumberland, was engaged in 
the campaign of the Carolinas, and mustered 
out at Washington, D. C, at tlic close of the 
war, June 8, 1865. Its first camping ground 
was Capitol Hill, Washington, where it re- 
mained until .September 17, drilling, equipping 
and performing camp guard duty : it next 
went to Arlington Heights, where it drilled 
until September 29. and from there pitched 
camp in Pleasant Valley. Here the regiment 
was assigned to the Second Brigade (Briga- 
dier-General Thomas C. Kane), First Divi- 
sion (Brigadier-General A. S. Williams), 
Twelfth Corps (Major-General H. W. Slo- 
cum). The regiment went into camp in Lou- 
don Valley during the months of November 
and December, 1862, and was thoroughly 
drilled : on January 24. 1863, the regiment 
went into camp at Stafiford Court House to 
remain fur the winter. On the morning of 
April 27, 1863, orders came to ])ack up and 



move on the thirtieth; it struck the Freder- 
icksburg plank road, and here was ordered to 
silence a battery worked by rebel cavalrymen, 
which they did — this was the first time the 
boys had been under fire. It was the begin- 
ning of the Chancellorsville battle. On May 
3, 1863, the battle commenced and raged with 
great fury for more than four long hours, and 
finally ended in repulse (although the boys 
fought like Spartans) and were ordered back 
behind their breastworks, where many of 
their brave comrades lay dead and many were 
wounded : this ended the battle, with one hun- 
dred and thirty-five killed, wounded and miss- 
ing. 

The following is an account of the battle 
of Gettysburg: July i, 1863, the regiment 
struck the road leading to Gettysburg; news 
came from the front that our forces were en- 
gaging the rebels near Gettysburg, near Span- 
gle Springs ; they threw up breastworks, mak- 
ing works that would stand a shell ; on July 
3, at I o'clock p. m.. the enemy opened fire 
with one hundred and fifty guns on the center 
and left, the position of General Hancock's 
corps ; the Union batteries, equal in number 
and calibre, replied promptly, and for the fol- 
lowing two hours the earth shook and trem- 
bled under the feet of the two armies with the 
terrible concussion ; the air was filled with iron 
missiles ; forest trees were riven and torn and 
splintered as if struck by lightning; shells 
fell thick and fast around the regiment, three 
hundred pieces of artillery were in action, and 
such a terrific roar was never heard before 
and probably never will be heard again. .'\n- 
other sharp fight occurred later in the after- 
ncxjn, driving the rebels back with great 
slaughter; this ended the terrible Gettysburg 
battles. On July 4th large details were made 
to bury the dead, and this duty occupied the 
entire day. The corps to which the regiment 
belonged buried that day fifteen hundred dead 
rebels ; the dead lay in every imaginable shape. 
On Cemetery Hill and in the National Ceme- 
tery now sleep the brave boys who fell at Get- 
tysburg; here repose the precious oft'erings 
laid upon the altar of the country by the loyal 
states ; there they lie, those of the rank and 
file, "Unknown" ! "Unknown" ! the only epi- 
taph of hundreds. Eight hundred and sixty- 
seven dead .sons was the sacrifice which New 
York gave at this battle ; the One Hundred 
and Twenty-third Regiment lost twelve in 
killed and wounded. New York furnished 
four hundred and forty-eight thousand eight 
hundred and fifty men to repress the rebellion ; 
ninety-two separate commands were engaged 
in this battle.

in the battle of Chancellorsville, May 3, 1863 ; 
battle of Gettysburg, July 3, 1863. He was 
also engaged under General Sherman in Geor- 
gia as follows : Battle of Resaca, Georgia, May 
15, 1864, with eight men killed and wounded; 
battle of Cassvillc, May 19. 1864, the regi- 
ment gaining this battle without loss of life 
and took possession of Cassville, the enemy 
falling back : battle of Dallas, or New Hope 
Church, May 25, 1864, killed and wounded in 
this division nine hundred and fifty men ; bat- 
tle of Gulp's Farm, June 22, 1864, in this fight 
the regiment losing forty-eight men killed and 
wounded and missing, while only eighty-three 
men were lost in the entire brigade ; after the 
battle the boys buried their comrades, burying 
them in their army blue where they fell fight- 
ing the foe. The boys were thoroughly ex- 
hausted by the incessant marching, exposure 
and privation of a fifty-nine days campaign. 
Corporal Richard Durham was taken prisoner 
at the latter-named battle, was confined in An- 
dersonville prison, and was prisoner of war 
until close of hostilities, June 8, 1865. He made 
several attempts to escape, but was each time 
recaptured ; on his way to prison he jumped 
from a moving train, shots were fired after 
him, missing their mark ; he ran to the woods, 
bloodhounds were put on his track, which 
chased him up a tree, and at the point of 
bayonets he surrendered ; he escaped again, 
living on berries and persimmons for four 
days, at the expiration of which time nature 
gave out ; he then went to a southern home 
for food and gave himself up. Another time 
he managed to secure a rebel suit, and went 
into their camp, but when roll call came was 
unable to give a rebel name and was arrested 
for a spy and sentenced to be shot, when a 
hasty call came for more men, and for some 
reason, which he never learned, his life was 
spared and he was made a prisoner again. He 
made two other unsuccessful attempts, after 
which he concluded it was impossible to reach 
the L^nion army. 

Andersonville Prison, Georgia, was one of 
the worst during the civil war. A brute 
named W'irz. the keeper, will go down in his- 
tory for his inhumanity to the men ; he placed 
the slop houses over the little stream of water 
running through the stockade, polluting the 
water used for all purposes. While Corpo- 
ral Durham was confined there, after a hard 
shower one night, a pure flow of water burst 
forth from a rise of ground within the stock- 
ade : the prisoners named it "the Providential 
Spring." and spoke of it with great reverence. 
Who will say this was not the work of a kind 
heavenly Father to place pure water within 
reach of the famishing prisoners, making it 



impossible for the cruel Wirz to pollute; it 
was still flowing at the close of the war. In 
this prison pen many of our noble boys were 
laid to rest through exposure, starvation and 
the dread disease, scurvy, with the added bru- 
talities of Captain Wirz. the Swiss keeper, 
who showed a fiendish delight in adding to 
the tortures of those committed to his care, 
and who richly merited being tried and sen- 
tenced to the hanging which he suflfered. No- 
vember 10, 1865. He was the only person ex- 
ecuted for the part he took in the war. 

At the close of the war, Corporal Richard 
Durham returned to his father's home in 
North Hebron, Washington county. New 
York, and remained there until March 12, 
1868, the date of his marriage to Rosalinda, 
daughter of Daniel and Lucina (Woodard) 
Braymer. The following eleven years he en- 
gaged in farming in Hebron, New York, then 
removed to Salem, Washington county, where 
he engaged in the feed business for three 
years. He then went west and entered into 
partnership with Daniel Braymer, his brother- 
in-law, in the ranch and cattle business in New 
Mexico, continuing for ten years. He then 
returned to Hebron, New York, and engaged 
in the general grocery business in Granville, 
continuing for seven years. He was a man 
o'f sterling worth, honorable and upright in 
all his dealings, charitable and kind hearted, 
giving liberally to all good works. He was a 
member of the First Baptist Church of Gran- 
ville, and was a Republican in politics. He 
served as captain on the round-ups in New 
Mexico, and as assessor and supervi.sor for 
two terms in the town of Hebron. He was 
a member of the Free and Accepted Masons. 
The widow of Corporal Durham resides in 
Granville. 



The name of Eldredge. or, 
ELDREDGE as it was originally written, 

Eldred, is of Saxon origin. 
The name dates to the very earliest Saxon 
days in England. John Eldred, of Great Sax- 
ham, in Suffolk, England, was born in 1552 
and died in 1632. He was one of the found- 
ers of Virginia, and from 1609 to 1624 was 
a member of his Majesty's Council for the 
Virginia Company of London. The brass tab- 
let to "John Eldred, the Navigator," at Great 
Saxham, England, has the arms of the East 
India Merchants, the Levant or Turkey Mer- 
chants, and the Russia Merchants Companies. 
He left four sons and two daughters. The 
Pilgrims who came to America in the "May- 
flower" in 1620 obtained a patent from the 
London Company, and through contrary winds 
were landed at Cape Cod instead of in Mr- 



lyie

ginia, as tliey intended. As John Eldred was 
for fifteen years a director of the Virginia 
Company of London, it is likely that the El- 
dreds who appeared in New England between 
the years 1635 and 1645 were in some way 
connected with him. The name was early 
spelled Eldred, Eldredg and Eldridge, and 
later Eldredge, some branches using Eldridge. 

(I) The family appeared in the Mohawk 
Valley about the years 1780- 1790, the first set- 
tler being Barnabas Eldredge, who settled in 
Schoharie county. He reached his destina- 
tion with a cash capital of ten dollars, en- 
gaged in farming and other business enter- 
prises, and at his death possessed an estate 
of one thousand acres in Schoharie county, 
besides property in Ohio. He was the lead- 
ing financier of his town and had the privi- 
lege granted him of issuing his own script or 
money. He married Doshia Wadsworth, and 
had Nancey, Robert, David, Adna, Franklin, 
Seth, Charles, Leray, Sally and Clinton. Do- 
shia died ]\Iay 30, 1831. Barnabas then mar- 
ried Sarah Peck, who died April 25, 1873. 

(H) Clinton, son of Barnabas Eldredge, 
was born in Schoharie county. New York, in 
1812, died 1897. He was a prosperous farmer 
of the county, his farm lying in the town of 
Sharon. He married Catherine, born August, 
1812, died May, 1900, daughter of Andrew 
Moyer. Children, all born in Schoharie 
county: i. Seward, married Eliza Best; chil- 
dren : i. Orin, married Estella Ward, and had 
Seward and Joseph, ii. Lena, married Duane 
Snyder, resides at Sharon Springs, and has a 
large family. 2. Wadsworth. married Cath- 
erine Eckler ; children : Myron, Beardsley, 
Ella and Bertha. 3. Sarah, married Thomas 
S. Powell: children: J. Sands, Thomas, Anna 
and Bessie. 4. James P., married Louise Al- 
ger, and had a large family. 5. Odillon B., 
married Mary Ough ; children: Ford, Harry 
and Ethal. 6. Henry, died in infancy. 7. 
Harry Moyer, of further mention. 8. An- 
drew, died at the age of thirty-six years. 9. 
Grace G., married Henry Skinner, and has 
Bertha. 

(HI) Henry Moyer. son of Clinton and 
Catherine ( Moyer ) Eldredge, was born in 
Leesville, Schoharie county. New York, 
March 27, 185 1. He was educated in the pub- 
lic schools and under private instruction. He 
decided upon a profession, and choosing law, 
entered the law office of Alonzo B. Coons, at 
Sharon Springs. April, 1876, where he made 
thorough preparation. He taught in the pub- 
lic schools of Montgomery county during his 
years of legal preparation, and in 1877 was 
elected justice of the peace of the town of 
Sharon. He was admitted to the bar Septem- 



ber 5, 1879. He practiced for one year in 
Sharon Springs, then in March, 1880, removed 
to Fort Plain, Montgomery county. New 
York, where he has passed thirty busy, event- 
ful years in the practice of his profession, in 
official life and as general man of business. 
For several years he was corporation attorney 
for the villages of Williston and Fort Plain, 
and successfully defended every case brought 
against them both in the lower court and on 
appeal to the appellate division. Two of these 
suits against the village of Fort Plain were 
for large amounts. They were decided in 
favor of the village, but appeals were taken. 
Mr. Eldredge argued the cases before the ap- 
pellate division of the Supreme Court, which 
sustained the decision of the lower court. 
Numberless instances could be cited of im- 
portant cases in which he has figured as the 
successful chief or assistant counsel. He is 
a capable, skillful lawyer, a trusted and effi- 
cient public official, and in business most ener- 
getic and successful. His generosity is pro- 
verbial and unostentatious. For eight years 
he was clerk of the board of supervisors of 
Montgomery county, for sixteen years justice 
of the peace ; director of the Farmers and Me- 
chanics Bank : director of the Empire State 
Metal Wheel Company ; treasurer of the 
school board, and interested in other activi- 
ties of his village and county. In 1906 he was 
the candidate of his party for county judge, 
but failed of an election. He is a Methodist 
in religious faith. He is a member of Fort 
Plain Lodge, No. 433, Free and .'Xccepted Ma- 
sons, and of the Knights of Pythias. In poli- 
tics he is a Democrat. He married, Septem- 
ber 29. 1880, Ida C. Dunkle, daughter of 
Aaron and Irena (Hess) Dunkle, whose chil- 
dren are: i. Mary, married George W. Spra- 
ker. 2. Adam, married Elizabeth Eldredge. 
3. Saline, married George H. Eldredge. 4. 
Ida C, married Henry M. Eldredge. 5. Mar- 
garet, married Edward Copley. 6. Lewis A., 
married Florence Giesler. 



The Cottrells of Greenwich, 
COTTRELL Washington county, New 

York, descend from Nicho- 
las Cottrell, of Westerly, Rhode Island, wdio 
was an inhabitant there in 1638. and in 1670 a 
deputy. There is no record of his birth, death 
or marriage, but there are records of four chil- 
dren — Nicholas (2), Gershom, John and Ja- 
besh. Nicholas (2) died 1716; was constable 
i688, deputy 1696; admitted to Stonington

body, Rhode Island; he married Ann, daugh- 
ter of John Peabody ; no issue recorded. 

It is" from this family that Nathan Cottrell, 
the Washington county pioneer, came. There 
is an interval between the second and the sixth 
generations that cannot be supplied, but the 
proofs are strong as to his descent. His mar- 
riage to Mary TefTt, a daughter or relative of 
Judge Nathan Tefift, who came from the 
same state, Rhode Island, shows family ac- 
quaintance in their New England home.

(The Tefft Line). 

(I) John Tefft, the immigrant ancestor, set- 
tled in Portsmouth, King's Town, Rhode 
Island, where he became a freeman in 1655. 
In 1648 William Tefft, of Boston, died, and 
in his will gave to the eldest child of his 
brother Tefft "least steer Calf." William may 
have been a brother of John. John Tefft is 
next mentioned in 1662, November 22, when 
he and his wife Mary sold seven acres of 
land to Robert Shink, of Newport. May, 
167 1, his name is recorded as an inhabitant 
of Pettaquamscott. His will was dated No- 
vember 30, 1674, and mentioned his son-in- 
law, Samuel Wilson ; wife Mary ; sons Samuel 
and Joshua, and daughter Tabitha. On Janu- 
ary 26, 1676, his death is mentioned in a let- 
ter from Captain James Oliver (written at the 
house of Richard Smith in Narragansett). 
Captain Oliver says first, that Joshua Tefft 
had married a Wamponag squaw, then that 
he had shot twenty times at the English in 
the Narragansett fight, and was captured and 
executed at Providence, and declares that he 
was "a sad wretch, he never heard a sermon 
but once these fourteen years. His father, 
going to recall him, lost his head and lies un- 
buried (i(')76)." On November 19 the widow 
signed in satisfaction of her thirds, her sig- 
nature being witnessed by Tabitha Gardiner.

tioned below; Joshua, died January 18, 1676, 
executed by the English; Tabitha, born 1653, 
died 1722. 

(II) Samuel, son of John Tefft, was born in 
1644, and died in 1725. He married Eliza- 
beth, daughter of Joseph and Esther (Pjal- 
lard) Jencks. She was born in 1652, and died 
1740. In 1677 he was admitted a freeman 
{Providence). On May 12, 1679, he was fined 



twenty shillings for not attending jury, but 
March 12, 1680, his fine was remitted by the 
assembly, as he had had no warning by the 
general sergeant. September 6, 1687, he was 
an inhabitant of King's Town, and was taxed 
there. On June 28, 1709, )ie and twenty-six 
others bought the tract of land called Swamp- 
town, part of the vacant lands of Narragan- 
sett. On March 20, 1721, he called his age 
about seventy-seven years, and October 29, 
1722, his wife Elizabeth called her age seventy 
years, though other evidence makes her not 
quite so old. His will, dated March 16, 1725, 
proved December 20, 1725, mentions his wife

This branch of the Miller fam- 
MILLER ily of Albany traces through 

four generations direct to the 
Fatherland. The name was anglicized in the 
first generation and has always since been 
spelled Miller, although the German family, 
who are numerous in Hanau, are Muellers and 
Muhlers. 

(I) Christian Miller, founder of this 
branch, came to New York City when a lad of 
twelve years. He was born in Hanau, Ger- 
many, and died in Albany, New York. He 
settled in New York City on coming to this 
country, and served an apprenticeship with 
William Smith, a grocer, who so thoroughly 
taught him the business that in a few years he 
was capable of conducting a store of I'lis own. 
He located in Albany, where he conducted a 
general store on the same plot of ground now 
occupied by John Keeler's State Street Res- 
taurant. This property which he purchased 
remained in the family until a few years ago, 
passing out of their control in 1906. He was 
a member of the Dutch Reformed Church of 
Albany, and a man of good standing in the 
city. He married. 

(II) William C, son of Christian IMiller, 
was born in Albany, New York, where his life 
was passed. He died in Albany. He married 
(first) a Van Schaick. 

(HI) Ernest John, son of William C. Mil- 
ler, was born in Albany, New York, and died 
in that city in 1896. He was educated at Al- 
bany Boys' Academy and graduated from Rut- 
gers College, New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
He chose law, and fitted for that profession 
at the Albany Law School. He practiced in 
Albany for several years, then abandoned his 
profession for the sake of engaging in manu- 
facturing as vice-president and treasurer of 
the Albany Card and Paper Company. He 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



was a member of the Dutch Reformed Church 
and a Repubhcan in politics. He married Jes- 
sie, daughter of Dr. Peter MacNaughton, of 
Albany, for over half a century a leading citi- 
zen and physician of that city. Children: i. 
William C, of New York City, now connected 
with the Edison Electric Company as engi- 
neer to the controller ; he married Virginia 
Temple. 2. Jane Guest, died August 4, 1888. 
3. Ernest Livingston, a retail coal dealer of 
Albany, married Edith, daughter of Edward 
Easton, Sr. 4. MacNaughton, of further 
mention. 

(IV) MacNaughton Miller, youngest son 
of Ernest John and Jessie (MacNaughton) 
Miller, was born in Albany, New York, April 
19. ^^73- He was educated at the Albany 
Academy, and began his business career as a 
messenger in the Commercial Bank of Al- 
bany, rising through successive promotions to 
the position of individual bookkeeper. In 
1902 he became assistant cashier of the Park 
Bank, holding that position until the Park be- 
came merged with the Union Trust Company. 
He was elected assistant treasurer of the lat- 
ter institution, advanced to the position of sec- 
retary, and is now (1911) secretary and treas- 
urer. He is a deacon of the Dutch Reformed 
Church, and a Republican in politics. He is 
a member of the Albany Academy Alumni 
Association, and the Fort Orange and Rac- 
quet clubs of Albany. For seven years Mr. 
Miller served in the Third Signal Corps, New 
York National Guard, ranking as first ser- 
geant. He married, June 20, 1899, Caroline 
Baxter Cobb, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, 
daughter of Rev. Sanford H. Cobb, a minis- 
ter of the Dutch Reformed Church. Child, 
Ernest John Miller (2), born July 21, 1906. 



The family name of Cuyler is 
CUYLER believed to have been derived 

from the German word " Kel- 
ler" — a wild boar of the forest — and would 
therefore signify a powerful man. "Keiler" 
is also spelled "Keuler," and both of these 
words have exactly the same sound as the 
Dutch "Cuyler."' Had the name been adop- 
ted in what is understood as modern times, 
then it would corresjrand to the form "Kui- 
ler" or "Kuilder," meaning a man who fishes 
with a "kuil." which is a bag-.shaped fishnet, 
and the family name would accordingly sig- 
nify one who was a fi.sherman when the name 
was originally applied. The Dutch word 
"Kuyl" signifies a pit or hole, and it is not so 
consistent to state that "Kuyler" meant one 
who digs a hole, or is a delver. or to follow 
the analogy by employing other synonymous 
terms. 



The Cuyler arms, modified and bv some 
considered more attractive than the earliest 
form known, both in design and coloring, and 
which has been in common use in America for 
probably a century or more, is described as 
follows : Shield : Per pale, embattled gules 
and azure, an arrow in bend, or, barbed and 
flighted, argent, point upwards. Crest: On 
a mural crown proper, a battleaxe erect, sur- 
mounted by two arrows in saltire, or. flighted 
argent, points downwards. Motto: (Dutch) 
Ik vertrouw op God, niet op pijlen; (Latin) 
Deo non sagittis fido ; (English) I trust in 
God, not in arrows. When printing the mot- 
to in capital letters in Dutch, the word "pij- 
len" would be spelled "pylen," with the two 
small marks above the letter "y," a form not 
always accessible in printing books, conse- 
quently the equivalent "i j" is employed. At 
tention is here called to the fact that "God" 
is the Dutch word for "Gott" in the German, 
and the motto is in Dutch. 

The impression in the wax, made when 
Annatje Schepmoes, widow of Hendrick Cuy- 
ler, the progenitor, sealed her will, about the 
year 1700, shows the single arrow in the field, 
pointing upwards, with the initial letter of his 
Christian name, "H," in the lower left cor- 
ner, and the letter "C" in the upper right 
corner. This is the property of Mrs. De 
Lancey Nicoll, of New York City. 

That the Cuyler family held eminent posi- 
tion in Holland long before the year 1600 has 
been demonstrated by the thorough research 
made among the archives in that country 
through the persistence of Mrs. Maud 
Churchill Nicoll to seek out the family's early 
history, and the interesting fact has been es- 
tablished by her that this family probably 
antedates any other in Holland in the use of 
a surname, which goes to show the advance- 
ment of the family at an early period. 

In this country it was not long before the 
family was recognized in a distinctive manner, 
beyond all disputation, for the appointments 
of the chief officials in the colony were made 
by the English Crown, and the choice in- 
variably fell to the man of eminence. Next 
after the position of governor, which office 
was filled by the English government send- 
ing an Englishman of prominence across the 
water to represent the king or queen, as the 
case might be, the selection of a mayor was 
the highest rank, and he was a man residing 
in the colony, hence the colonist could receive 
no greater recognition. New York and Al- 
bany were the principal cities in the colony. 

The Cuyler family was the peer of all oth- 
ers, as the following facts will show, aside 
from what creditable estimates many histor- 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



1721 



ians have written respecting it, and it is here 
set forth that from the time Albany became 
a city, July 22, 1686, to the time of the revo- 
lution, some one of the Cuyler name and 
direct line was either mayor of Albany or 
closely related to one who was, such as a wife, 
brother or son. It is interesting to the gen- 
eral historian as an illustration of the inter- 
marriage of leading families in founding a 
city. 

Johannes Cuyler, son of Hendrick Cuyler, 
the progenitor, was appointed (14th) mayor 
of Albany by Cov. William Burnet, and offi- 
ciated from (ktober 14, 1725. until November 
7. 1726. ■

Catalyntje, daughter of (loth) Mayor Jo- 
hannes Schuyler. 

Abraham Cuyler. secpnd child of Hendrick 
Cuyler, the progenitor, married (1689) Cath- 
erine, daughter of (7th) Mayor Jan Jansen 
Bleecker. 

Sara Cuyler, third child of Hendrick Cuy- 
ler, the progenitor, married (6th) Mayor Pie- 
ter \'an I'.rugh, in 1688. 

Rachel Cuyler, fifth child of Hendrick 
Cuyler, the progenitor, married (13th) 
Mayor Myndert Schuyler, in 1693. 

Maria Cuyler, sixth child of Hendrick Cuy- 
ler, the progenitor, married (ist) Mayor 
John Cruger, of New York City, in 1703, and 
John, son of Maria Cuyler and Mayor John 
Cruger, was mayor of New York, 1756-65. 

Sara Cuyler, daughter of Mayor Johannes 
Cuyler, married (17th) Mayor Johannes Han- 
sen, in 1723. 

Sara Cuyler's husband. Mayor Johannes 
Hansen, had sister Debora, who was mother 
of (29th) Mayor Johannes Jacobse Beeck- 
man, having married Jacob Beeckman. 

Anna Cuyler, daughter of Mayor Johannes 
Cuyler, married (1712) the nephew of (ist) 
Mayor Pieter Schuyler, Anthony Van 
Schaick. 

Sara Cuyler, daughter of Mayor Johannes 
Cuyler, married (1723) Johannes, son of 
(5th) Mayor Hendrick Hansen. 



Elsje Cuyler, daughter of Mayor Johaiuies 
Cuyler, married (1724) Hendrick Roseboom, 
tirst cousin of the wife of (24th) Mayor Sy- 
brant Gosen Van Schaick, Alida Ro.seboom. 

.\braham Cuyler's wife, Caatje (or Cath- 
erine) Bleecker, was a sister of (8th) Mayor 
Johannes Bleecker, Jr., and also of (15th) 
Mayor Rutger Bleecker, both being sons of 
(7th) Mayor Jan Jansen Bleecker. 

Abraham Cuyler's son, Johannes .'\braham 
Cuyler, married (1727) Catharina Wendell,, 
whose aunt, Maria \\'endell, was wife of 
(23rd) Mayor Robert Sanders. 

.\braham Cuyler's daughter, Catharina, 
married (22nd) Mayor Jacob Coenraedt Ten 
Eyck, in 1736. 

Abraham Cuyler's daughter, Margarita, 
married (21st) Mayor Dirck Ten Broeck, in 
1714. 

Margarita Cuyler's daughter, Christina 
Ten Broeck, married (1740) Philip Living- 
ston, signer of the declaration. 

Margarita Cuyler's granddaughter, Cather- 
ine Livingston, married (32nd) Mayor I'hilip 
Stephen \'an Rensselaer, in 1787. 

Margarita Cuyler's son, Dirck Ten Broeck, 
married (25th) Mayor \'olckert P. Douw's 
daughter, Anna, in 1761. 

Margarita Cuyler's grandson was (28th) 
Mayor Abraham Ten Broeck. 

.■\nna Cuyler, daughter of Rachel Cuyler 
and Mayor Alyndert Schuyler, married (i6th) 
Mayor johanpes De Peyster, in 1715. 

.\ critical inspection of the above list 
shows that thirty of the earliest thirty-two 
mayors of Albany were of close Cuyler blood 
or else married into the family. 

James Riker, in his "'History of Harlem." 
says, in speaking of Mayor Johannes Cuyler. 
eldest son of the progenitor: "Erom him and 
his brothers come the respectable family of 
Cuyler, allied from an early day to many oth- 
ers noted in the annals of New York." 

( I ) Hendrick Cuyler was progenitor of the 
entire family of that name in this country. 
His father was Isobrant Cuyler, whose wife 
bore the Christian name of Evertien. or Ev- 
ertje. 

He was born at Has.selt, a city in the prov- 
ince of Overyssel, Holland, a few miles north' 
of Zolle. and he was baptized there .August 
II, 1637.* TTc (lied in New York, N. Y., in 
1690. 

Hendrick Cuyler settled in Beverwyck in 
1664, when the place was changing from the 
Dutch rule, known as Dorpe Beverwyck, to 
that of the English, when it became known 
for the first time (Sei)tember 24, 1664) as 
Albany. He was a tailor, and was successful

in accumulating considerable property. He 
bought a lot on the hill, on the east side of 
North Pearl street, near State street, and 
■owned a lot in 1680 on the south side of 
State, west of Pearl street, "near ye Fort," 
which was located in the center of the former 
broad thoroughfare at its intersection with 
Lodge street. After his death this lot and 
house passed into the possession of his son- 
in-law. Mayor Pieter Van Brugh. 

In 1675 he made his brother Reynier, then 
residing in Holland, "cnoopemaecker tot Am- 
sterdam" (button-maker residing at Amster- 
dam), his attorney, in order to receive cer- 
tain property from Pieter Nicolaas Gouver- 
neur. He had a house built for him at Al- 
bany in 1680, evidently the one on the lot last 
described. It was erected from timber cut 
and prepared in New York City. Jan Nagel, 
Jan Dyckman, Arent Hermens Bussing, 
Adolph Meyer and Jan Delamater were kept 
busy in that year hewing timber to fill a 
contract made January 2, 1680, with Nico- 
laas de Meyer, as his agent, for whom they 
were to furnish timber, including "beams, 
posts, rafters, plates, sleepers, door-posts and 
casings, according to the plan thereof," to be 
delivered in the ensuing May, part at the 
waterside and part in New York City at tiie 
Burgher's Path, for which they were to re- 
ceive "1,300 guilders, with a half-ancker of 
rum, to-wit : one-third in silver money or 
sewant, one-third in good winter wheat, and 
one-third in goods at such price as he (De 
Meyer) sells the same at his store for cur- 
rent .sewant." 

He eventually returned to New York to 
live, where he and his wife united with the 
Dutch church by letter, November 29, 1688, 
two years before his death. He married, at 
New Amsterdam (New York City), Annatje 
Schepmoes, born in that city and died there, 
daughter of Jan Jansen Schepmoes and Sara 
Pieterse. Cliildren : Johannes, Abraham, 
Sara, Delia, Rachel, Maria. Eva. Hendrick. 

(II) Johannes Cuyler, first child of Hen- 
drick Cuyler and Annatje Schepmoes, was 
born in Holland in 1661, and died at Albany, 
New York, July 20, 1740, where he was bur- 
ied in the Dutch church. 

He was one of the most prominent traders 
of the place, and acquired wealth ; was admit- 
ted a freeman of New York City in 1696, 
where he resided for a time; attended the 
Dutch Reformed Church of Albany, where- 
of he was a deacon in 1695 and 1700, and in 
later years was elder. He was Commissioner 
•of Indian AflFairs for a number of years, be- 
ginning with 1706, and was also alderman. 
'Gov. William Buniet appointed him four- 



teenth mayor of Albany, and he officiated 
from October 14, 1725, to November 7, 1726. 
His residence was on the east side of North 
Pearl, the second house south of Steuben 
street, with his extensive lot extending 
through the block to Yaugh (now James) 
street. 

His son, Cornells Cuyler, became the twen- 
tieth mayor of Albany by appointment of 
Lieut.-Gov. George Clarke, serving from Oc- 
tober 14, 1742, to September 28, 1746, and, 
in turn, the .son of Mayor Cornelis Cuyler, 
Colonel Abraham Cornelis Cuyler, became the 
twenty-sixth mayor of Albany by appoint- 
ment of Lieut.-Gov. Cadwallader Golden, serv- 
ing from September 10, 1770, to April 16, 
1778. His daughter Sara married (Apr. 25, 
1723) Johannes Hansen, seventeenth mayor, 
by appointment of President Rip Van Dam, 
and reappointed by Gov. James De Lancey, 
with terms from October 14, 1731, to October 
22, 1732, and from 1754 to 1756. In this 
manner, it might be put, that Johannes Cuy- 
ler. his son. grandson and his daughter, occu- 
pied the municipal "White House" through- 
out fourteen years. 

Mayor Johannes Cuyler married, Albany, 
November 2, 1684, Elsje Ten Broeck, born

the stockades, the same having been the resi- 
dence, of his father-in-law, Hendrick Cuyler, 
the progenitor. His family name. Van Brugh, 
was also spelled Van Brug and Verbrugge, 
possibly derived from the fact that the family 
had residence in Bruges, Belgium, more likely 
than of the small town of Brugg, Switzerland, 
and yet the English equivalent of the Dutch 
word (which has been used) w-as Bridge, sig- 
nifying a family from near a certain bridge.

ruary 9. 1690, and had married, at New Am-

baptized there, February 28, 1697; buried in 
Dutch Church there, September 16, 1750: 
married, Albany, November 24, 1715, Mayor

(U) Maria Cuyler, sixth child of Hen- 
drick Cuvler and Annatje Schepmoes, was 
born in New York. N. Y., March 3. 1678: 
baptized there, March 13 ; died September 
14, 1724. She married, March 5, 1703, John 
Cruger. He was the progenitor of the entire 
Cruger family in America. He came to New 
Amsterdam prior to 1700; settled there; be- 
came alderman, 1712-1733: was mayor of 
New York beginning with the year 1739 until 
his death in 1744; died in New York City, 
August 13, 1744, and was buried in the old 
Dutch Church. 

During early history, and at different pe- 
riods, the ancestral members of the Cruger 
family settled in Germany, Holland, Den- 
mark and England. At the time of the Dan- 
ish invasion of England, or possibly after the 
conquest of England, about 1016, it is prob- 
able that some of the members of this family 
went to England, as Sir Philip De Cruciger 
(from whom the English branch traces de- 
scent) subsequently accompanied King Rich- 
ard on the Crusades. Other members of the 
familv remaining in or returning to Germany, 
and they, as also those emigrating from there, 
trace their descent from the baronial house 



of Van Cruger. One of the translators of 
the Bible, with Luther, was named Cruciger 
(Cruger). At Bristol, England, within the 
old Cathedral walls and in the adjoining 
church yard, are many ancient monuments 
and slabs to the memory of members of the 
Cruger family, some of whom came from the 
continent in the reign of Henry \"nL 

Regarding the name of Cruger, in the 
transmutations which this family name has 
undergone, the origin is found to be Cruci- 
ger, derived from the Latin Crux-Gero, to 
carry the cross, or cross-bearer. The Cruger 
Arms: Shield: Argent, a bend azure 
charged with three martlets or, between two 
greyhounds courant, proper. Crest : A demi- 
greyhound statant, gorged or. Motto : Deo 
non fortuna; beneath the crest. Fides.

who was energetic in erecting a new church 
edifice at llie intersection of Broadway and 
State street, which was built of stone about 
the dilapidated one which had been con- 
structed of wood in 1656, and no picture of 
any other subject in entire Albany is now re- 
garded as more typical of the old Dutch days. 
He drew up a ])etition June 8. 1714, signed 
by himself, the elders and deacons, requesting 
the approval of Robert Hunter, captain-gen- 
eral and governor of the ])rovinces of Xew 
York and Xew Jersey, for proceeding there- 
with, which was granted, and the building 
was first occupied October 30, 171 5, conse- 
crated November 13. He also had the church 
incorporated by petition of August 3 : ap- 
proved August 10, 1720, and this building 
endured until rebuilt on the south side of 
Beaver street, in 1806, from the same ma- 
terial, in order to facilitate traffic on State 
street, where it had stood in the middle of 
the principal thoroughfare. He also supplied

(\T) Col. William Tremper Cuyler, fifth 
child of Johannes Cornelis Cuyler and Han- 
nah Maley. was born at Albany. New York, 
December 22. 1802, and died at "Woodlands," 
Cuylerville, Livingston county, New York, 
December 21, 1864. He was buried in the 
Cuyler lot of Mount Hope cemetery at Roch- 
ester, New York, and his grave indicated by 
a granite monolith. 

He received his education as one of the 



first students attending the Albany Academy,, 
and resided in that city until about the time- 
of his majority. The Erie canal was then 
nearing completion, and he was imbued witb 
the idea that it was to open up the rich grain 
and grazing sections of the western part of 
the state, for up to that time very little of the 
population had settled to much of any extent 
farther westward than Schenectady, except- 
ing in isolated cases, and such cities as Roch- 
ester, Buffalo and Detroit were hardly more 
than embryotic villages when he was a youth. 
Rochester was his choice, and he bought the- 
"Crystal Building," on East Main street, es- 
tablishing a large carriage manufactory,, 
while his residence was on North St. Paul 
street. It was here that he married Char- 
lotte Hanford, about 1823, probably on at- 
taining his twenty-first year, and she a girl 
of seventeen years. He became a member of 
the Presbyterian church of Rochester, and' 
this change of his religious views from the- 
Dutch Reformed church of his ancestors for 
two centuries was probably due to the fact 
that his second wife, Nancy Bancker Stewart,, 
came of a Scotch family ; but the other mem- 
bers of his family turned instead to the Epis- 
copalian faith. He received his title as colonel' 
of the New York state militia. 

About the year 1830. Colonel Cuyler de- 
cided to dispose of his property in Rochester 
so as to participate in the development of the 
country near Geneseo, New York. He turned 
his business over to his brother-in-law, George 
Hanford, who formed a partnership with 
Thomas Askin, both of whom had been his 
apprentices, and in 18..13 they removed their 
manufactory to Cuylerville. The Genesee- 
Valley canal was being dug at the time Colo- 
nel Cuyler decided on exchanging his Roches- 
ter property for a large tract of most admir- 
able farming land in that beautiful valley. 
He seized the opportunity to lay out the town, 
some four miles southwest of Geneseo, which 
grew into a thriving village and was given 
his name — Cuylerville. His own property, 
on which he resided, he named "Woodlands," 
because at the rear of his handsome home 
was a dense forest of pines. The house' 
stood at the top of a long and gradual in- 
cline leading to a wooded plateau ; but before- 
it lay the valley unobstructed to the view. 
Any number of letters of that time which 
were written by visitors to his home to friends 
at other places never failed to style it "a pal- 
ace," and undoubtedly it was then one of the- 
finest specimens of colonial style of architec- 
ture in the state, if people still living are tc 
be believed. It was of wood, painted white- 
and cream ; had the ornamental, tall columns,.

and an elaborate portico. We are told by 
those who have been there, that the view from 
his piazza across the valley was entrancing, 
for the landscape comprised miles of the rich- 
est verdure in the state, and much of it was 
owned by him. It was his pleasure, as was 
common with the \\'ads\vorths and other 
wealthy neighbors with landed estates, to 
breed fine horses, as well as superior strains 
of sheep and cattle. 

The property named "Woodlands," which 
Colonel Cuyler owned, had been bought in 
1810 by Hon. Samuel Miles Hopkins, jointly 
with B. W. Rogers, "which tract of land had 
been reserved by the Indians as, above all 
others, choice and delightful," as is recorded 
in the autobiography of Mr. Hopkins, a law- 
yer of standing, who lived in New York and 
Albany, before going West. Mr. Hopkins 
further said of the locality: "If the habitable 
globe contains any places more entirely ex- 
cellent and desirable than these two adjoin- 
ing tracts (Mount Morris and Leicester, in 
Livingston county, N. Y.) I know it not." 
Regarding the time when the house was built, 
he says: "In 1811, I removed to Geneseo, 
the village of my old and excellent friends, 
James and William Wadsworth. From here 
I superintended my farm with unsparing dili- 
gence and care, until I could have a house 
prepared. In 1812, the war. In 1813-14, I 
was a member of the thirteenth congress, an 
election which was contrary to my expecta- 
tion and wishes, and to the duties of which 
my farm and building forbade my giving much 
attention. * * * So I staid in Washing- 
ton as little as I could. * * * j„ these 
same years I built my house. In August, 
1814. I laid out the village of Moscow on a 
plain which far and wide was covered with 
a young growth of oak and hickory, so thick 
as to be almost impervious, and such as pre- 
vented me from getting any just knowledge 
of the extent and shape of the plain, except 
bv actual mathematical survey. * * * 
From the Genesee river my operations ex- 
tended back to the pine woods, near three 
miles." Moscow is about one mile distant 
from Cuylerville. and the dense pine forest 
back of "Woodlands" had never been entered 
up to this time by any other man than the 
wild Indian. 

The estate of Mr. Hopkins was valued in 
1817 definitelv at $7.=;.ooo, but in 1822, be- 
cause of hard times throughout the country, 
it had so depreciated that he "was glad to 
accept a check of $2^,000 for the whole," and 
"in the spring of 1822, I sold off, paid off, 
broke up. and traced my course back to Al- 
bany," where he resumed his practice of the 



law. Colonel William T. Cuyler obtained the 
property by a deed of conveyance from Camp- 
bell H. Young, of Geneseo, and on his death 
it remained in control of his third wife, Anna 
De Peyster Douw (Cuyler) until it passed 
into the hands of Colonel Cuyler's son, George 
M. Cuyler, on the probate of her will at Al- 
bany, November 9, 1871, together with "all 
my horses, cattle, livestock and implements 
of husbandry upon the aforesaid property." 

The home of Colonel Cuyler was constantly 
the scene of guests and of much entertaining. 
He was somewhat handsome in appearance, 
stately in bearing, standing erect, blue eyes 
and auburn-brown hair. About the home- 
stead were a great many flower-beds, which, 
were attended by the women of his family.- 
The house was furnished with the beautiful 
furniture of the day when the carving of solid 
mahogany pieces was at its height in art treat- 
ment. There were many family portraits 
upon the wall, and the silver was of the quaint 
pattern of the C'olonial period, which had been 
handed down for generations. Disaster over- 
took much of this valuable household prop- 
erty, for a fire broke out at noon on Febru- 
ary 22, 1857, caused by a detective flue in 
Mrs. Cuyler's room, and the residence was 
burned to the ground quickly. One of the 
mose serious losses was that of the old family 
Bible, with its entries in the Dutch language. 
The sideboard, which was saved, was offered 
for sale in 1910 for $500. Colonel Cuyler 
did not rebuild : but removed his family to 
Rochester, where he resided on South Wash- 
ington street ; but his only living son, George, 
remained at "Woodlands" for twenty years 
thereafter, occupying one of the other houses 
on the estate. Colonel Cuyler died there, 
while on a visit to his son. He was stricken 
with apoplexy while inspecting the stock ; was 
carried into the house bv his son, and died 
within a few hours, although the previous 
night he had been in unusually good spirits 
and enjoying apparently excellent health. 

Colonel William T. Cuyler married (first) 
Charlotte Hanford. in 1823, or January, 1824, 
as their first child was born in November, 
1824. She died at "Woodlands," Cuylerville, 
April 12, 1831, "in her 26th year," and, when 
twenty-five years old, had borne four chil- 
dren. She was born, accordingly, in 1805 or 
1806, and is buried in Mount Hope cemetery 
at Rochester, with all her children and her 
husband. Colonel Cuyler married (second), 
at the Clute homestead, between Moscow and' 
Squawkie Hill, in 1837, Nancy Bancker Stew- 
art, born at Leicester, New York. March,

The family name of Dexter is 

DEXTER derived from the title of the 
English city, Exeter, in Dev- 
onshire, written as though the person came 
from there, D' Exeter, and then contracted 
into Dexter. The Dexter arms : Shield : Ar- 
gent, two chevrons azure, a canton gules. 
Crest : A tree, pendant therefrom two 
weights. 

Richard de Excester, progenitor of the fam- 
ily in Ireland, and who died in 1269. was 
governor and lord chief justice of Ireland, 
and it is believed that he emigrated from Dev- 
onshire, for there are good reasons. Other 
changes in the spelling of the name, leading 
to the common and more modern form of 
Dexter, were de Excester, Dexcestre, Dex- 
cester, Dexetir, Decetir, de Exon, de Exonia 
and de Exeter. 

The family traces descent from Richard de 
Exonia (Exeter), to whom was certified a 
grant by Edward I., king of England, August 
9, 1 28 1, made by Philip de Monte Gomeri 
(filed '"MtGomery"), which reads, in part: 
"Know all men both of the present and the 
future that I Philip de Monte Gomeri have 
given and granted and by this my present 
charter confirmed to my Lord Richard de 
Exonia and his heirs or his assignees one 
townland in Connaught — which is called 
Moyletrath which my Lord the King gave to 
me with all its appurtenances — for him and 
his heirs or his assignees to have and to hold 
in chief from my Lord the King — with moors, 
pastures, waters, and all liberties and free 
usages pertaining to the said townland ; — free- 
ly, quietly, happily, peacefully, entirely, hon- 
orably and hereditarily forever, and for this, 
to my Lord the King and his heirs Richard 
himself and his heirs or his assignees are to 
give the twentieth part of the service in fief 
of one soldier for all service, suit in court, 
collection or demand." 

King Edward I. made a grant on June 12, 
1304, to Richard de Exonia for an important 
tract situated in Connaught, Ireland, as fol- 
lows: "Be it known that we have given and 
granted on our own part and that of our heirs 
to our beloved and faithful Richard de Ex- 
onia nine townlands with their appurtenances 
in Connaught, in Ireland, namely townlands of 
Dengvnmacossen, Conylloscv, Narraghtyn, 
Corkillebrangyle, Corcropanlistostv, Rathfar- 
eth. Tohirnetalpie. Torpan and Monynannan

which the same Richard holds in tenancy by 
ihe commission of our beloved and faithful 
John Wogan our Justiciar in Ireland, made 
for the same Richard under our direction for 
■eighteen pounds delivered to us yearly at our 
•exchequer in Dublin, in accordance with the 
certification made at our order by the afore- 
said Justiciar and returned to us under the 
seal of the same Justiciar." 

Concerning the appointment of Richard de 
Exonia as Chief Justiciar on the bench in 
Dublin: "Be it known that we have ap- 
pointed our beloved and faithful Richard de 
Exonia our Chief Justiciar on our bench in 
Dublin for hearing and deciding pleas on the 
same bench, together with our other faithful 
Judiciars assigned to this place according to 
law and custom of these parts as long as we 
shall please. In (testimony) of which, etc. 
L'nder the hand of the King at Langeleye on 
the fifth day of June, 1308." 

Carrickdexter was long the seat of the chief 
■branch of the Dexter family, until Genet 
Dexter, its heiress, married into the Rock- 
fort family. Two miles from there, in the 
year 1585, lived Margaret Dexter, in the Cas- 
tle of Rathaldon. She married ^lichael Cu- 
sacke. This estate is now in the town of 
Slane, and is possessed by the Marquis of 
Conyngham, while upon the property still 
may be seen the ruins of the house that is 
called Castle Dexter. 

( I) Richard Dexter, progenitor of the fam- 
ily in America, was born about the year 1606. 
He came from within ten miles of the town 
•of Slane. in county Meath, Ireland, where 
lived the descendants of Richard de Excester, 
the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. When the 
great Irish massacre of the Protestants be- 
gan, October 27, 1641, Richard Dexter took 
his wife, Bridget, together with three or more 
children, and fled to England. He remained 
there only a brief time, for he was residing 
in Boston, Massachusetts, prior to February 
28. 1642, as on that day he was admitted a 
"Townsman" of that place. Upon what ves- 
sel he sailed is unknown. He signed a peti- 
tion as an inhabitant of Charlestown, Mystic 
side. May 16, 1648. and he resided there un- 
til he purchased a farm in Maiden, Massa- 
chusetts, December 7, 1663; but from Janu- 
ary, 1677-78, until his death, he probably 
lived with either his daughter Elizabeth or 
Aun. He and his wife were members of the 
church at Maiden, and in 16^0 she signed a 
petition from that church to the general court. 
He signed a remonstrance to the general 
court. May 16, 1643, with the inhabitants of 
"Mvstic side, against a proposed highway from 
W^innisimmet to Reading, as the Maiden rec- 



ords state. He received a deed from Edward 
Lane, of Boston, December 7, 1663, of a 
farm containing forty acres, in Maiden, and 
the same property, later increased to two hun- 
dred acres, was occupied several centuries 
by his descendants in direct line. He al.so re- 
ceived a deed as early as 1650, from Robert 
Long, and still others, at subsequent periods. 
In 1666-67, he gave a deed of some of his 
property to "James Melius," who 1iath mar- 
ried my daughter Elizabeth, — mariner, of 
Charlestown," and who was supposed to have 
been lost at sea practicing his vocation. In 
a deed of January, 1677, he speaks of his de- 
ceased son-in-law as "the late James Meal- 
ings." 

By a deed dated February 24, 1674, evident- 
ly looking to the closing of his estate before 
his death, he made provision as follows: "to 
my Sonne John, of Charlestown, of all my 
farm-houses and lands, and appurtenances be- 
longing, which I have in Maiden, and which 
I bought formerly of Mr. Edward Lane : and 
half of my land and wood near Spot Pond, 
being part of the lot given me by the town of 
Charlestown — excepting one acre of marsh 
land near Blanchard's farm, and about four 
acres my dwelling house stands upon, for 
my daughter Ann Pratt's use, where her 
house now standeth — John to pay him 10 
pounds a year during his life — 5 pounds in 
Indian corn and pork, at prices current, and 
12 loads of wood, to be delivered at his dweel- 
ing house in Charlestown, with half of the 
apples." 

It is set forth in the records of those times 
that Richard Dexter was a tythingman, prob- 
ably of Boston, and according to the records 
of the Middlesex court he was styled "Con- 
.stable." According to his testimony in that 
court in 1666, he was that year sixty-eight 
years of age. In 1652 he was residing in 
Misticke, as then written, according to a docu- 
ment of September 22 of that year. His wife, 
who was born about 1612. died about 1675, 
and he died at Charlestown, Massachusetts, 
in 1680. 

Children: i. Alice, died between Novem- 
ber 25, 1681, and August 22, 1682; married, 
about 1653, Benjamin Muzzy, and had Ben- 
jamin, born April 16, 1657; Joseph, horn 
March 1, i6!;8-59, and Sarah. 2. Elizabeth,

(H) John, third child of Richard and Brid-

Massachusetts, December 8, 1677. The farm 
upon which he lived was transferred to him 
by his father, February 24, 1674-75 ; but re- 
serving to himself for life a free rental. At 
this time his residence was stated as Charles- 
town, where his daughter was born. He was 
fatally shot in the back by Captain Samuel 
Hunting, surviving the accident four days. 
He married Sarah, who afterwards married 
(before April 2, 1684) William Boardman, 
and possibly had a third husband, Daniel 
Hitchins. of Lynn, Massachusetts. Boardman 
was admitted freeman of Maiden, March 12,

(HI) John (2), eldest child of John (i)and 
Sarah Dexter, was born August 21, 1671, 
died at Maiden, Massachusetts, November 14, 
1722. In deeds he was styled a weaver, and 
possessed the farm at Maiden, receiving a 
deed for one-fourth of it from his brother, 
Richard, May 19, 1703, in consideration of 
sixty pounds, and one-fourth from his sister, 
Sarah, of Boston, May 6, 1697, for a like 
amount, and as his father made no will, he 
probably acquired the half of it as being the 
oldest .son and so entitled by the law of that 
period. He was a deacon in Maiden church ; 
selectman in years 1709- 10- 16- 17-21 ; moder- 
ator of a town meeting in 1722. Captain 
John Dexter was in command of a company 
of foot under George I. The commission 
issued to him is of interest, and it reads : "To 
John Dexter, Gentleman, Greeting: "By ver- 
tue of the Power and Authority, in and by His 
Majesty's Royal Commission to Me granted, 
to be Captain-General, &c. over His Majes- 
try's Province of the Massachusetts Bay,

Courage and good conduct, constitute and

dering and Exercising said Foot Company in 



Arms, both Inferior Officers and Souldiers;. 
and to keep them in good Order and Disci- 
pline; hereby commanding them to Obey you 
as their Captain." This was dated September 
16, 1717, and was signed by Samuel Shute. 
He left all his estate to his wife for his chil- 
dren, with the conditional understanding that 
if she remarried, John and Richard were to 
pay her twelve pounds yearly. 

Captain John Dexter married Winnefred 
Sprague. born at Maiden, December 31, 1673,. 
died there December 5, 1752, daughter of

(IV) Rev. Samuel De.xter, third child of 
Captain John (2) Dexter and \\'innefred 
(Sprague) Dexter, was born at JNIalden, Mas- 
sachuetts, October 23, 1700, died at Dedham,. 
Massachusetts, January 29. 1755. He received 
from his father by will one hundred ]X)unds. 
being a smaller sum than was bequeathed to 
his brothers, with one hundred and fifty 
pounds to be added after his mother's death, 
and for this extra allowance he waited long, 
for she lived a widow thirty }ears. However, 
when his father made the distribution of his 
property while alive, he recorded the fact 
that he had given to Samuel both learning 
and books. He was of unusual studious quali- 
ties, and was .sent to Harvard, graduating in 
1720. He was admitted to the church May 
I, 1720, ordained May 6. 1724. as the fourth 
mini.ster of the First Church of Dedham. and 
continued as such until his death, at that time 
under the charge of Rev. Alvan Lamson. He 
had kept school previously at Taunton, for 
six months, and commenced a school at Lynn, 
February, 1721, where he continued for one 
year, and then engaged in teaching in Mai- 
den, continuing for six months. From that 
time he improved himself in preaching. He 
received an unanimous call to be rector, with- 
an oflFer of one hundred and fifty pounds 
yearly salary. His reply shows the sincerity 
of the man, and in its quaintness is of inter- 
est, commencing as follows : "Honored and' 
Beloved : Seeing that the Sovereign Jehovah,.

in whose hands are the hearts of all men.

so far as you have done for my support, 1 do 
therefore hereby declare (though with trem- 
bling, do I engage in so great a work, for 
who is sufficient for these things?) that I 
freely embrace your invitation, because I be- 
lieve it to be my incumbent duty, and thank- 
fully accept your offers." 

He married, Boston. Massachusetts, July 9. 
172^, Catherine Mears. born at Boston, Sep- 
tember 25. 1 701. died at Dedham, June 10, 
1797. daughter of Samuel Mears (born May 
22. 1671. died May 10, 1727) and Maria 
Catherine (Smith) Mears, daughter of Cap- 
tain Thomas Smith, mariner, whose portrait 
is in the Hall of American Antiquities at 
Worcester. Massachusetts. Mrs. Samuel Dex- 
ter married, when a widow, Samuel Barnard, 
of Salem, Massachusetts. 

The Rev. Samuel Dexter had all the temer- 
ity of the timid lover of the stage or novel 
when approaching the subject of selecting and 
winning a life partner. In his diary he made 
record on November 22, 1723: "This day 
was very cold. I communicated .something of 
my mind to the young lady — which I hope 
(and I think I have reason to hope), may, 
through the smiles of indulgent Providence 
be the Person in whom I may find the good 
thing, and obtain favor of the Lord. I think 
I have not been rash in my proceedings, she 
is as far as I can find, a Woman of Merit, 
a woman of good temper, and of prudent con- 
duct and conversation, and oh ! Lord I would 
humbly wait upon thee for so signal a Bless- 
ing." He was evidently successful in his 
hopes and surmises, for he wrote in his diary, 
under date of October 23, 1724, this quaintly 
worded sentence: "My companion is a kind, 
tender, and virtuous person, and I hope I have 
in her a good thing, which is from the Lord 
God, make her so to me." 

Her father kept a public house, as then 
termed, called the "George Tavern," located 
on the line between Boston and Duxbury, 
which was burned July 31, 1775, and he then 
conducted the Sun Tavern in Cock-court, 
Dock Square, and after that the "Governor 
Hancock." ^^'hen Samuel Mears died, Rev. 
Mr. Dexter wrote of him: "He was in gen- 
eral, a just, honest man and very charitable 
for one of his capacity ; had a very hard 
death, and I hope has exchanged earth for 
heaven. My wife has lost a tender, loving 



father, and I have lost a very kind, bountiful 
friend."

Of the remarkably fine character of Mrs. 
Samuel Dexter, it was said: "Seldom has 
death during the last half century bereaved 
us of one leaving such records of goodness as 
the late Mrs. Samuel Dexter. So well was 
her kindly heart known and appreciated, that 
when strangers in former times made this city 
their temporary residence, often disheartened 
and afflicted, they were reminded that one 
hospitable door was open to them, where they 
could meet a cordial welcome, and find all 
the delights of home, in which word is cen- 
tered most that is dear to us. In her dwell- 
ing was seen all that taste and ingenuity could 
dictate. So entirely free was she from all sel- 
fishness, that no enjoyment was prized unless 
shared with others. If truth showed frailities 
in members of the community, she never cen- 
sured them. The poor had experienced her 
kindness so long, that they relied as confi- 
dently upon the stores set apart for them 
as if in their own possession, and her contri- 
butions were bestowed in so kind a manner 
that the wretched never lost their self-re- 
spect."

born in Minaville. Florida township. ^lont-

Dr. Stephen and Lydia (Bartlett) Reynolds. 
5. George, see forward. 

(\'1I) George, son of Samuel (2) and Eliz- 
abeth (Province) Dexter, was born at Al- 
bany, New York, July 2, 1799. died there 
July 21, 1883. After being given an elemen- 
tary education in the city schools, he was 
sent, at the age of sixteen, to Union College, 
from which he graduated with full honors. 



He studied law, was admitted, but never prac- 
ticed. In his early life he manifested those 
traits of self-reliance and energy which en- 
abled him subsequently to be the architect of 
his own fortune. About 1827, when he mar- 
ried, he engaged in business with Henry 
Rawles and James Archibald McClure in the 
drug business, locating on the south side 
of State street, which firm became one of 
great prominence, as its business spread, un- 
til it eventually vied with those in the me- 
tropolis. After a time he withdrew and went 
into business on his own account at No. 57 
State street, and his place was known as 
"Apothecaries' Hall." In 1850 he formed a 
partnership with Joseph Nellegar, and ac- 
quired the property at the northeast corner 
of State and Pearl streets, the most promi- 
nent intersection of streets in Albany's busi- 
ness section. This partnership continued for 
eighteen years when, having secured a com- 
fortable fortune by the application of the rule 
of absolutely fair dealing, he retired. 

In 1839 ^nd 1840 he yielded to solicitations 
of friends to enter political life, and was 
chosen to represent the old fifth ward in the 
board of supervisors, and he was elected in 
1848 and 1849 to represent the sixth ward in 
the common council. He was actively con- 
cerned in the founding of the Albany I\ledi- 
cal College, and for a number of years was a 
trustee. For a very long time he was a ves- 
tryman of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, and 
on his death w^as senior warden. The rector. 
Rev. Dr. Walton W. Battershall, paid his 
memory the following tribute: "His life of 
eighty-three years was to a singular degree 
identified with the history of the parish. From 
his baptism in the little, stone church that 
stood underneath the fort in the middle of 
State street, the first Episcopal church west 
of the Hudson river in all America — what a 
host of memories concerning the history of 
this city and this parish were gathered up in 
his life. He represented much that was best 
in its type of character and life. The cour- 
tesy of the old days, the simple tastes, the 
spotless integrity, the faith and reverence, the 
.serenity and content and freedom from the 
push and rush of these more recent days — 
all these were conspicuous traits of his char- 
acter, and entered into the kindly, genial flow 
of his life. He was a man who won your 
trust and love, and he never betrayed them. 
The world, the church, the life of the house- 
hold, and friendship, and business, has need 
of such men — men whose fidelity you can lean 
on as an oaken staff. They are the moral salt 
of a community, and their memories are a 
])rccious inheritance and an inspiration to

gentle and true and loyal living." The vestry 
of St. Peter's made record, in part, as follows : 
"He was a man of great beauty of character, 
whose kind and genial nature made his life 
rich in friendships, and who sustained all the 
trusts and relations of life with a rare cour- 
tesy, dignity and fidelity. He was for many 
j'ears a member of the vestry, giving to it his 
judicious counsel and unwearied labors. We 
order the chancel draped with the customary 
badge of mourning." 

.Vfter retiring from business, he continued 
to occupy an office on the ground floor of 
the same building, where he was wont to 
meet with his friends daily for the sole pur- 
pose of continuing the intimate companion- 
ship of a large circle of acquaintances, and 
was a most entertaining conversationalist, for 
his recollections comprised a varied lot of 
most interesting local history, dating back to 
the time when he made the trip, in company 
with his father, upon the first journey of 
Robert Fulton's famous steamboat, the 
"Clermont." He could also vividly describe 
the visit of Lafayette, September 17, 1824, 
when given a rousing, public reception by 
the city. 

He was in his nature strongly conserva- 
tive, always honest, sincere and upright in 
his purposes and conduct. He was a staunch 
adherent of the old Whig party, as long as it 
lasted, and he then became an earnest sup- 
porter of the Republicans. He was a liberal 
contributor to all the public charities and be- 
nevolent enterprises. He was a trustee of 
the .Mbany Savings Bank for many years, un- 
til his death. 

Bishop \\'illiam Croswell Doane made this 
tribute in his address before the convention 
of the Episcopal Church, in 1884. "A very 
prominent figure has passed away from Al- 
bany in the death of Mr. George Dexter, for 
many years one of the mo.st active and useful 
members of the vestry of St. Peter's church, 
and at the time of his death, its senior war- 
den. I miss his kindly greeting, which was 
almost a daily pleasure in my life upon the 
street, and the whole town misses him. as one 
of the few left of the old-fashioned gentlemen 
of Albany, 'a serene and genial old friend, 
who. without being garrulous, took pleasure 
in stirring up his old-time reminiscences of 
people and things in the Albany of a former 
day. He loved to talk,' I quote from the same 
graceful notice of him l)y my dear friend, Mr. 
Orlando Meads, 'of the school and school- 
mistresses of his early years, of the clergy- 
men, and especially of the old rectors of St. 
Peter's, their habits, peculiarities and the 
manv interesting facts connected with them. 



All these things made him a centre of loving 
interest to his friends. His was a beautiful, 
serene old age, tempered by time; strength- 
ened by a firm and quiet religious faith ; but 
ever preserving its interest in the happiness 
and welfare of those about him, and thus it 
came gently and peacefully to its close, leav- 
ing us pleasant remembrances of a good and 
useful and benignant life.'" He was buried 
in the Albany Rural cemetery, and in the 
nave of St. Peter's Church a window of beau- 
tiful, artistic execution was placed to his 
memory as its warden. 

George Dexter married, at .Mbany. New 
York. April 5, 1827, Mary Magdalen Cuyler, 
born at Fort Johnson, Johnstown, New York, 
the historic place of Sir William Johnson, 
February 3. 1810, died at Albany, October 4, 
1847, daughter of John Cornelius and Han- 
nah (Maley) Cuyler. Children, born at .Al- 
bany: I. .Anna Augu.sla, July 16, 1833, see 
forward. 2. Catherine Cuyler, March 4, 1837, 
unmarried. 3. Cynthia Reynolds, October 14, 
1839, died at Albany, November 23, 1893. un- 
married. 4. Mary, June 27, 1845, died there, 
February 7, 1848. 

(VHI) Anna Augusta, eldest child of 
George and Mary Magdalen (Cuyler) Dex- 
ter, was born at .Albany, New York, July 16, 
1833. She married (first), in St. Peter's 
Church, Albany, .April 6, 1858, William James 
Noyes, who died at Old Lyme, Connecticut, 
January 31, i860, without issue. She married 
(second), in St. Peter's Church. Albany, Oc- 
tober 25, 1866, William Henry Bradford. He 
was born at New York. New York, Septem- 
ber 22, 1812, died at his home in that city, 
December 30. 1895. .son of William and Eliza 
(Price) Bradford. In the latter years of his 
life, he bought property at Lenox, Massachu- 
setts, where his family was living in 191 1. 

Mr. Bradford was eighth in direct descent 
from William Bradford, governor of Plym- 
outh Colony. The line of descent reaches to 
William Bradford, of .Austerfield. a small 
village on the .southern border of Yorkshire, 
England, who held the rank of "Yeoman," 
and was one of the only two persons of prop- 
erty then in that place. His .son, William, 
was born in 1561. died in i.Sgi; married 
Alice Hanson, in 1584. Their third child 
(first son). William, was born in .Austerfield, 
March, 1^90: was placed in care of his grand- 
father, being left an infant, and when 
he died, was brought up by an uncle. 
When twelve years old, he was deeply 
impressed by listening to the reading of 
the Scriptures, and later joined the band 
of worshipers known as .Separatists, who 
were accustomed to assemble in the house of

William Brewster, in Scrooby, an atljacent 
village. Religious persecution followed, and 
James I. declared he would "harry them out 
of the land, or worse." Under such condi- 
tions, they removed to Holland, where they 
could worship freely in their own way. They 
were about to start from Boston, England, 
when the king, through the treachery of the 
captain of the vessel, confined seven of them 
in prison. Bradford, being youthful, was re- 
leased sooner than the others, and proceeded 
to Zealand, Holland, where he was accused 
of being an English fugitive ; but, on explain- 
ing his cause, was allowed to go, and joined 
his friends at Amsterdam, where he became 
a silk dyer. 

At the end of three years Bradford came 
into possession of his inheritance, which 
he converted into cash, and established him- 
self in business. In 1609 the colony removed 
to Leyden, staying there about ten years, when 
he was one of those agitating for moving 
elsewhere. They proceeded to England. 
With others, he engaged in purchasing the 
sailing vessels "Speedwell" and "Mayflower." 
The former proving unseaworthy, they em- 
barked aboard the latter, and, although in- 
tending to settle near the Hudson river, they 
entered Cape Cod harbor on the morning of 
November 11, 1620, and just before passing 
in, drew up a compact which they signed. 

In the explorations to select the most prop- 
er place to locate, Bradford was one of the 
prime movers. While away on one of these 
hazardous trips, likely to come across sav- 
ages and wild beasts, his wife was accidentally 
drowned. On December 21, 1620, the band 
landed at Plymouth. It was a forlorn party 
of courageous souls, and their struggle that 
winter was severe, for six of them died in 
December, eight in January, seventeen in Feb- 
ruary and thirteen in March. The following 
month, the "Mayflower" sailed back to Eng- 
land, and they were left to their own re- 
sources, cut entirely loose from home and 
all assistance or supplies. Shortly thereafter. 
Carver, their leader, died, and William Brad- 
ford was chosen governor. He ruled wisely, 
holding this office for the long jieriod of thir- 
ty-seven years, with the exception of the 
three-year term of Edward Winslow and the 
two-year term of Mr. Prince. 

He won the unbounded respect of all in the 
colony. Understanding the character of the 
Indians thoroughly, his tact and bravery 
counted for much at several critical periods. 
A new and larger patent was granted them 
in 1629, in the name of "William Bradford, 
his heirs, associates and assigns." Bradford 
displayed judicious management and lessened 



their extreme misery as time went on. De- 
spite his meagre opportunity in youth to ac- 
quire more than a fair education, he was by 
natural bent able to improve himself, and he 
studied the languages that he might, as he 
put it, "see with his own eyes the ancient 
oracles of God in their native beauty." In 
this manner he became familiar with Greek, 
Hebrew, Latin and Dutch, at the same time 
reading much of history, philosophy and re- 
ligion. He was unusually active with his pen, 
as was discovered after his death, and his 
writings have been published, but only one 
appearing in print while he lived. 

Governor William Bradford married, in 
1623, the widow, Alice (Carpenter) South- 
worth, for his second wife, who died at New 
Plymouth, Massachusetts, March 26, 1670, 
aged eighty years, and he died May 9, 1657. 
By his first marriage he had a son named 
John, who was a deputy to the court at Plym- 
outh, from Duxbury, iii 1651, and from 
Marshfield, in 1653. No record of his mar- 
riage has ever been learned. By his second 
wife, he had William. Mercy and Joseph. 
The eldest of these. Major William Brad- 
ford, was born June 17, 1624, died February 
20, 1704, and married successively Alice Rich- 
ards, of Weymouth ; the Widow Wiswall, and 
Mary (Atwood) Holmes, widow of Rev. John 
Holmes, the first minister of Duxbury and 
daughter of Deacon John Atwood, of Plym- 
outh. The Bradford arms : Shield : Gules,

Tudge Randall James Le 

LE BOEUF Hoeuf, son of Peter J. and 
Sarah A. (Saunders) Le 
r>oeuf. was bom in Cohoes, New York, March 
lo, 1870. 

Judge Le Boeuf's father was of French 
descent, and a resident of Canada in his 
youth, coming there from France when a 
xrhild. He was sent into the United States 
for his education, and graduated from the 
Fort Edward Institute in New York state. 
Shortly afterwards he engaged in the manu- 
facture of axes in Cohoes. After that he 
removed to Troy, New York, where he was 
actively concerned in the manufacture of 
collars, cuffs, and shirts, the leading industry 
of that city. He was for a number of years 
a member of the firm of Wheeler, Allendorf 
& LeBoeuf, afterwards Wheeler, Le Boeuf 
& Company. 

The ancestors of Judge Le Boeuf's mother, 
the Saunders family, came to this country 
from Scotland in colonial days, settling first 
on the Taunton and Providence, Rhode 
Island "plantations," as they were then styled, 
several of this family playing most important 
parts in the struggle for independence. Her 
father was Randall Saunders, a well-known 
resident of Albany in 1830, and members of 
this family moved into Columbia, Greene and 
L'lster counties. She was born at Albany, 
and was educated at the State Normal Col- 
lege. 

When nine years old. Judge Le Boeuf came 
to live in Albany, and attended the high 
school, from which he graduated in the class 
of 1887. He then took up the study of law 
in the office of the late Eugene Burlingame, 
an unusually bright lawyer and district attor- 
ney. In the fall of 1889, Judge Le Boeuf en- 
tered Cornell L'niversity, and graduated from 
the law department in 1892, with the degree 
LL. D. He was there one of the prize de- 
baters, and also received the thesis prize for 
his treatise of the law. He was made a mem- 
ber of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, and was 
president of both the junior and senior classes 
of the law school. A part of his work at Cor- 
nell was done under the supervision of 
Charles E. Hughes, later the governor of 
New York state and afterwards judge of the 
United States supreme court, then professor 
of law, and Mr. Le Boeuf's thesis on the 
rights and remedies of abutters on streets 
over which the elevated railroads were con- 
structed, procured for him, through the inter- 
est of members of the faculty of Cornell, a 
position as managing clerk in the law firm of 
Sackett & Bennett, who at that time did a 
large business for jjroperty owners in actions 



brought against the New York and Manhat- 
tan Elevated Company. During his connec- 
tion with this firm, he formed, what is be- 
lieved to have been, the first linotype labor 
union organized in the I'nited States. He 
also had considerable experience in the forma- 
tion of the model village of Larchmont, New 
York, which was built up from the proper- 
ties of the Larchmont Manor companies. 

Upon the return of Charles E. Hughes to 
his firm in New York City, known as Carter, 
Hughes & Kellogg, he entered the office of 
that firm as assistant attorney. He was of- 
fered the position by Walter S. Carter, who 
was the senior member of the law firm, fath- 
er-in-law of Governor Hughes, and a man of 
country-wide reputation as the friend and 
starter of young men. Mr. Le Boeuf consid- 
ered his connection with Governor Hughes 
to be equivalent to a liberal education in law 
matters, and the latter evidently noticed his 
response to earnest effort, for later Mr. Le 
Boeuf's application brought its reward. Mr. 
Le Boeuf was admitted to the bar at .Sara- 
toga Springs, New York, September 14, 1892. 
In 1895. Eugene Burlingame, with whom Mr. 
Le Boeuf had read law, having been elected 
district attorney for Albany county, Mr. Le 
Boeuf returned to Albany and formed a law 
partnership with him, which continued 
throughout Mr. Burlingame's first term and 
ended only with the-latter's sudden death in 
1898, during his second term of office. In 
November, 1897, j\lr. Le Boeuf drew the 
charter for the new city of Rensselaer, Co- 
lumbia county. New York, and was appoint- 
ed its first corporation counsel, remaining in 
that office consecutive years until 1902. It 
has ever been a source of satisfaction to him 
that he made a great number of friends dur- 
ing that period, and likewise had the benefit 
of the experience. After Mr. Burlingame's 
death, he formed a partnership with Surro- 
gate Newton B. Van Derzee and John T. 
Cook, ex-district attorney, and for several 
years they practiced in the Municipal Gas 
Company building on State street, Albany. 

In the year 1900 Mr. Le Boeuf undertook 
the formation of what became the Albany 
Trust Company, enlisting the assistance of a 
number of prominent citizens, both at .Albany 
and in New York, and the handsome building 
of its own was opened on September 5, 1904, 
the organization dating from March 20, 1900, 
when Mr. John D. Parsons, Jr., was chosen 
its president, who was also the president of 
the National Exchange Bank of .\lbany. He 
has given, since then, much time to its af- 
fairs, and has been a director and its legal 
counsel. He has also been interested in bank- 



1736

ing institutions in other cities, and as such 
was made a director of the Schenectady, Troy 
and Syracuse Trust Companies in those three 
cities. He has had large experience also in 
litigation affecting gas and electric lighting 
companies. He has been engaged in legal 
work for railroad corporations, and was at- 
torney for the Albany & Hudson Railroad 
Company, participating in the work of reor- 
ganization when forming the present Albany 
& Southern Railroad Company. His practice 
has not been confined to New York state, but 
has included cases of moment in the circuit 
courts of the United States and other Federal 
courts. He has had considerable familiarity 
with litigation affecting the rights of vessels 
navigating the waters of this state and tide 
waters. Governor Charles E. Hughes ap- 
pointed him a justice of the supreme court 
for this district, December 26, 1909, to suc- 
ceed the late Judge George H. Fitts, which 
appointment was generally satisfactory to 
those who knew him. To this high office he 
gave his best endeavors. 

When Justice Le Boeuf retired from office 
upon the expiration of his term, December 31, 
1910, it was made a notable occasion by those 
with whom he had been brought in contact. 
His desk had been piled high with a display 
of American Beauty roses, and he was over- 
come by the marks of appreciation. The Al- 
bany County Bar xA.s.sociation had drawn reso- 
lutions, to the effect that "his service upon 
the bench has been marked by the greatest 
degree of expedition consistent with a proper 
consideration of the multitude of important 
cases which have been presented to him for 
decision, and that the uniform patience and 
courteous consideration which have charac- 
terized his judicial relations, manifest that he 
is possessed of the temperament necessary in 
a judge." The resolutions further recited 
that the members of the bar in .\lbany county 
appreciate his service, which had served 
to demonstrate his worth, his excellent judg- 
ment, absolute fairness, energetic promptness 
in the despatch of matters brought before him, 
and his clear and unbiased interpretation of 
the laws. 

Judge Le Boeuf is a member of the New 
York State Bar Association, the .American 
Society of International Law, and of the Bar 
Association of Albany County. He is promi- 
nent among Masons, being a member of Mas- 
ters' Lodge. No. 5, and Capital City Chapter, 
Royal .4rch Masons, of De Witt Council, 
Royal and Select Masters, and vice-presi- 
dent of Cornell Alumni Association ; member 
of the executive council of the Delta Upsilon 
fraternity, of the Unconditional Republican 



Club and of the National Geographic Society, 
Fort Orange, University and Aurania clubs, 
and Pine Hills Association of Albany, and 
the Republican, Cornell and Railroad clubs of 
New York City. He is a trustee and vestry- 
man of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church of 
Albany, and resides at No. 531 Western ave- 
nue. 

Judge Le Boeuf married, at Albany, New 
York, June 3, 1896, Katharine Washburn, 
daughter of Hiram L. Washburn. Judge and 
Mrs. Le Boeuf have one child, Randall James 
Le Boeuf, Jr. Hiram L. Washburn was a 
dealer in real estate, residing at the northeast 
corner of Western avenue and Quail street, 
Albany. 



Frank Sweet Black, ex-governor 
BLACK of the state of New York, was- 

born at Livingston, York county, 
Maine, March 8, 1853. He was one of a. 
family of eleven children who were reared on 
a rocky farm with a fractious soil that did 
not respond liberally to the farmer's efforts. 
At the age of eleven his parents removed to 
Alfred, RIaine, where he attended the school' 
now known as Limerick Academy, going" 
from there to Lebanon Academy. He was a 
poor boy and his school days were frequently 
interrupted by the need of earning money. 
He taught school to earn enough to continue 
his course at Lebanon, where he organized 
a debating society and was one of the chief 
debaters. With some money gained in teach- 
ing and some obtained from his father (which 
later was repaid from his first earnins:s) he 
entered Dartmouth College in 1875. He was 
not well prepared, but by hard work made 
good the studies, in which he was deficient. 
As before, he taught school to pay his ex- 
penses ; one year he taught school at Cape- 
Cod. In his junior year he could only attend 
his classes eleven weeks of the session. While 
a senior he taught in Provincetown, Cape 
Cod, where he met Lois B. Hamlin, who on 
Thanksgiving Day, 1879, became his wife. 
Despite all his handicaps. Mr. Black was one 
of the honor men on Commencement Day, 
had been the editor of two college periodicals 
and had twice been chosen a prize speaker. 
His success in teaching brought him the high 
endorsement of the college faculty, and on 
graduation day he had the choice of three 
principalships offered him. But the law, not 
teaching, was his goal, and all the offers were 
refused. He joined forces with a fellow stu- 
dent, Henry W. Smith, of Troy, and together 
they established headquarters at Rome. New 
York, and began the sale of pictures, the 
craze at that particular time being chronios.

\\'hile so engaged, he became acquainted with 
\V. M. Irehmd, editor of the Johnstown, Ful- 
ton count)-, Journal, and librarian of the state 
senate at Albany, who was in need of a com- 
petent man to take charge of the journal. Mr. 
Blaclv accepted this position, and he was soon 
hard at work on both editorial and local pages 
of the journal. The great struggle was then 
on between the national giants, Blaine and 
Conkling. Being from Maine he warmly sup- 
ported the man from Elaine, overlooking the 
fact that Mr. Ireland was a political follower 
of Conkling. This led to a rupture and Mr. 
Black resigned. While engaged in editorial 
work he had begun the study of law with 
\\'ells, Dudley & Keck, of Fulton county. He 
now removed to Troy, New York, where he 
continued his legal study with Robertson & 
Foster, working in the meantime as reporter 
on the Troy Whig, in the office of the regis- 
try department of the Troy postofifice, and 
in the service of various legal papers. He 
soon became managing clerk in the office of 
Robertson & Foster, and had the distinction 
of operating the first typewriter ever used in 
Troy. He earned a part of his expense money 
by copying papers, becoming exceedingly ex- 
pert on the machine. In 1879, four years 
after his graduation, he was admitted to the 
bar. He accepted an offer of a partnership 
and became junior member of the la\v firm of 
Smith, Wellington & Black, continuing for 
one year, then went into business for himself, 
and opened offices in the Young building in 
Troy. He went into debt for law books, but 
when he had them, read and knew them. He 
worked hard, thoroughly prepared his cases 
and each year showed an increase in practice 
and income. In a few years he became known 
as a leader of the Rensselaer county bar and 
had his choice of cases. He always avoided 
criminal cases, but there were few civil cases 
of importance in the county in which he was 
not offered a retainer on one side or the 
other. His law library was one of the best in 
Troy, and every book in it gave signs of 
usage. In one month. August, 1893, there 
came to Mr. Black's legal care, the largest 
business that ever came to a law office in 
Troy in the same time. The passing into 
receivership of the Troy Steel & Iron Com- 
pany, and of the Gilbert Car Company, was 
an indication of his high standing in the legal 
fraternity. He was always a Republican in 
conviction, in experience and in service. lie 
was a campaign speaker for the Republican 
county committee in 1888 and 1892. Becom- 
ing aware of the election frauds in Troy, he 
drew up bills for presentation to the legisla- 
ture to make these frauds impossible. An ex- 



citing election followed, at which a Republican 
watcher, named Robert Ross, was murdered 
by a man named "Bat" Shea. Mr. Black or- 
ganized a committee of public safety, to se- 
cure the punishment of the murderer, who- 
ever he might be, and accomplished his ob- 
ject. Shea, after trial, was convicted and 
electrocuted. Mr. Black then continued his 
efiforts to reform the election laws and secured 
the passage of the O'Connor Inspector Act. 
As a natural result of his political activity in 
the fall of 1894, he was nominated and elected 
to congress. In the house he served on com- 
mittees, Pacific railroad and private land 
claims. In 1896 he was renominated, but 
there w-as a greater office before him. 1 le 
had been a delegate to the Republican Na- 
tional Convention that nominated McKinley, 
and had made a brilliant speech, when New 
York City ratified the nomination. His ca- 
pacity for public work of a high order had 
become known when his name was presented 
by Rensselaer and Columbia counties at the 
state convention held at Saratoga as a candi- 
date for governor, his speedy nomination over 
several strong candidates following. He made 
a series of strong speeches in the campaign 
that followed, and had the gratification of 
being elected by the largest plurality ever 
given a Republican candidate for governor, 
212,992. He was sworn into office January i, 
1897. He gave the state a strong administra- 
tion, which was specially marked by the com- 
pletion of the state capitol, which had been in 
course of construction so many years. The 
governor took hold of this problem in his 
u.sual thorough, vigorous manner, and the 
capitol w^as finished. After retiring from of- 
fice he returned to the practice of law, in 
which he has since added to his fame. He 
married, as stated, Lois Hamlin, daughter of 
Dr. Hamlin, of Provincetown, Massachusetts. 
He has one child, Arthur, who was fifteen 
years of age when his father was elected 
governor of New York state. Few men can 
look back over their lives with greater satis- 
faction than Frank Sweet Black, who, by 
.sheer force of character, rose from a lowly 
position to the highest. 



The Backus family is one of the 
B.\CKUS oldest in this country and in 

England, the line going back to 
Ecgberht, the first king of England, from him 
to Cerdic, the first king of the West Saxons, 
and tradition has it that this last named was 
a lineal descendant of Woden (or Odin), who 
was supposed to be descended from the eldest 
son of Noah. There have been many distin- 
guished men in this familv in addition'to those

so named as a mark of respect and esteem for 
William Backus, Norwich, England, having 
"been presumably his birthplace. The fine 
Backus Hospital at Norwich, Connecticut, also 
commemorates this fact. He was at Saybrook,

Backus was prepared for college at the Albany 
Academy, from which he was graduated at 
the age of fourteen years, and the home influ- 
ence of his mother, a woman noted for her 
sincere piety, left a deep impression upon him, 
which made its influence felt throughout his 
life. At the age of seventeen years he joined 
the Second Presbyterian Church of Albany,

nary, and a part of a year at the Yale Divinity 
School. He was licensed at the New York 
Presbytery, October 15. 1829, and was or- 
dained and installed in the First Presbyte- 
rian Church of Schenectady, to which he had 
received a call, December 6, 1832. He was 
pastor of this church until 1872, a period of 
forty years, and pastor emeritus from June 18, 
1873, until his death, frequently preaching 
during this latter period, although for nine 
years he was totally blind as the result of cat- 
aract. Union College bestowed upon him the 
degree of S. T. D. in 1847, and that of LL. D. 
in 1875. He was a member of the Albany 
Presbytery during his entire ministry, and in- 
fluential in its councils as well as in those of 
the synod and the general assembly. He 
served on many important committees, was a 
leader in the movement to unite the old and 
new school churches, and his ability was rec- 
ognized when he was elected, by acclamation, 
moderator of the reunion general assembly of 
1870, at Philadelphia. He was also foremost 
in the movement for the first Presbyterian 
Hymnal. He laid the corner stone of Reunion 
Hall, at Princeton, New Jersey. One of his 
marked characteristics was his executive abil- 
ity. As chairman for many years of the Home 
Mission Committee of Presbytery, he was of 
great influence in furthering the cause of for- 
eign and domestic missions. He served as 
trustee of Union College from 1852 until 1888, 
and for a number of years was president of 
the board of trustees. He was president of 



the board of trustees of the Young Men's 
Christian Association of Schenectady from its 
incorporation in 1871 until liis death, and was 
president of the board of trustees of the Home 
for the Friendless from its foundation in 
1868. His high character won for him the 
confidence of men both within and without 
his church, so that his counsel was widely 
sought and his words always listened to with 
unfeigned respect. It was largely through the 
efforts of Rev. Dr. Nott, who' early recog- 
nized the ability and worth of Dr. Backus, 
that he was brought to Schenectady, and they 
co-operated in furthering the interests of the 
city and the college. Dr. Backus was a mem- 
ber for several terms of the board of educa- 
tion of the city and his influence helped greatly 
to keep the schools in line with the more prcn 
gressive methods of education. In associa- 
tion with Dr. Nott he developed the beauty 
of the city by means of planting shade trees, 
the college nurseries furnishing many of the 
fine old elms which now adorn the streets. He 
was thoroughly catholic in spirit and sym- 
pathy, encouraging all feasible Christian 
union. The impression of Dr. Backus on the 
life of his own church, that of the city, its 
religious, educational and philanthropical de- 
velopment, is a lasting one, and one which 
will be of benefit for many generations to 
come. 

At the annual meeting of the Board of 
Trustees of Union College, which was held 
.at Schenectady, June 21, 1892, it was decided 
to put on record the following tribute to Dr. 
Backus: "Though a graduate of Columbia, 
he was for nearly sixty years closely identi- 
fied with the life of Union College. During 
forty years, as the minister of the Presbvte- 
rian Church, in the City of Schenectady,' he 
was the religious teacher and guide of many 
hundreds of her students, and stood in inti- 
mate relation with a long line of Presi- 
dents and Professors. For thirty-five years 
he was a Trustee of the Institution, eminent 
and influential in her councils, zealous and 
untiring in his eflforts to advance her inter- 
ests." The familiarity of Dr. Backus with 
the Scriptures was wonderful. During his 
later years, after the affliction of blindness 
had come upon him, he nevertheless fre- 
quently preached, and in the course of his ser- 
mon would recite long passages from the Bible 
and hymns, from memory, and was practically 
letter perfect. At the sermon preached be- 
tween the death and burial of Dr. Backus, 
by Rev. A. Russell Stevenson, D. D., pastor 
of the First Presbyterian Church, he said in 
part: "Our church is one hundred and twen- 
ty years old, and to-morrow we bury the pas-

tor who has been in our midst for the half of 
that period — but in estimating the influence of 
the man, the latter half of the one hundred 
and twenty years is manifold more valuable 
than the former."

poral, June 6, 1863, promoted sergeant, De- 
cember 14, 1863, mustered out June 16, 1865, 
at the close of the war, at Fort Federal Hill, 
Baltimore, Maryland. He saw hard service 



with the Army of the Potomac, and engaged 
in many of the hard-fought battles which 
made that army famous. After the war, be- 
ing still a young man, hardly out of his teens, 
he served an apprenticeship at collar cutting, 
and worked at that with several firms, finally 
becoming manager for Douglass Corning. 
This was the forerunner of several partner- 
ship agreements, D. Corning & Company, 
Corning & Barker, and on the death of Mr. 
Corning, Mr. Barker assumed the business 
under his own name and so continued until 
1899. In that year, desiring to admit his' son 
and some others to an interest in the business, 
a corporation was formed called the William 
Barker Company, of which he was the first 
president and so continues (1910). The com- 
pany manufactures the Barker brand of col- 
lars and cufi's ; their plant is located at Water- 
vliet, New York. Mr. Barker has other busi- 
ness interests and connections. He is di- 
rector of the Union National Bank, Troy, and 
of the National Bank of Watervliet, New 
York. He was a director of the Round Lake 
Camp Meeting Association, and of the Ameri- 
can Bank and Trust Company, of Pasadena, 
California, as well as having an interest in 
other corporations in which he held no offi- 
cial connection. Although he has retired from 
the more arduous labors of business, he re- 
mains at the head of William Barker Com- 
pany and retains all the interest of his 
younger days. He is a Republican in political 
sympathy, but never took active part in public 
affairs. He is a member of many of Troy's 
social and out-of-doors clubs, namely: The 
Troy, Colonial, Island Golf, Round Lake Golf 
and others. 

He married, at West Troy, Albany county. 
New York, June 23, 1868, Mary Emeline Day- 
ton, born in West Troy, December 15, 1844, 
daughter of Nathan Crary and Margaret 
(MacGillway) Dayton (see "Mayflower" line 
forward). The family residences have been 
at West Troy, Troy, Round Lake, New York, 
and Pasadena, California. The latter resi- 
dence is used a great deal by Mrs. Barker, 
who finds in that genial climate relief from 
bodily ailments that afflict her. Children: i. 
Edwin Dayton, died at age of nine years. 
2. William, see forward. 3. Frank Halliday, 
died aged five years. 4. Charles Moore, died 
aged three years. 5. Douglass Corning, died

Elizabeth Peabodie, mother of Sarah Rog- 
ers, born April 24. 1647, died 1707, was the 
daughter of William Peabodie, born 1620, 
died December 13, 1707. He married Eliza- 
beth Alden, born 1623-24. died May 31, 1717. 
Elizabeth Alden was daughter of John Al- 
den, born 1599, died September 12, 1687; 
married Priscilla IMolines, daughter of Wil- 
liam Molines, died February 21, 1621, and his 
wife Alice. William Molines was a passen- 
ger on the "Mayflower," as was his daughter 
Priscilla. later wife of John Alden, immor- 
talized by the poet Longfellow in his poem, 
'"The Courtship of Miles Standish." 

John Rogers (2), who married Elizabeth 
Peabodie, was a grandson of Thomas Rogers, 
who was the eighteenth signer of the "May- 
flower Compact," and died during the "first 
sickness." 

It is tlirough Hannah Miner, wife of Con- 
stant Searles, the Wyoming "martyr," that 
descent is traced from the Barkers of Troy to 
Christopher Avery, born 1590. died 1670, 
founder of the Connecticut family of Avery. 
The names traced in this brief genealogy in 
all cases lead to the first settlers in America 
and there are many not mentioned. The Mul- 
fords of Southampton, Long Island ; Thomp- 
sons of Roxbury, Massachusetts ; Palmers of 
Stonington, Connecticut : Wheelers of Ston- 
ington, Connecticut ; Parks of Salem. Massa- 
chusetts ; Lakes, Gallups. Woodruffs, and 
others, were all of English ancestry, and were 
among the very earliest settlers in America. 
The lines traced from Barker to the "May- 
flower" are fully authenticated and no link is 
missing to complete the record from William 
Barker (2) to Thomas Rogers and John .M- 
den and Priscilla Molines. Volumes could 
have been written concerning the pioneers of 
these families in settling early towns, in Mas- 
sachusetts and Connecticut, of their prowess 
as Indian fighters in King Philip's war, the 
French and Indian wars, the revolution, the 
war of 1812. the Mexican war and the great 
civil war: of their services in colony and state 
as officials ; of their piety and concern for the 
welfare of the church ; of their part in es- 
tablishing new industries and carrying them 
forward until the fame of New England as a 
manufacturing center was world-wide. Men 
high in the professions, in public life and in 
business bear these names which are now to 
be found in every part of the United States. 



Thomas Laing, the first of the 
L.MNG line here under consideration, 

was born in Langholm. Scotland, 
about the year 1723, died in Salem, New 
York, August 27, 1825, aged one hundred and 



two years. He came to this country wheni 
about forty years of age. The supposition- 
is that he came with the company of Scotch 
under Campbell who came to Saratoga county,. 
New York, under promises of grants which 
were not kept. On the voyage he met and' 
became enamored with Agnes Miller, born in 
Scotland, 1747, whom he subsequently mar- 
ried. They settled in Saratoga county, New 
Y'ork. Some time later, according to tradi- 
tion, they walked over to Cambridge, Wash- 
ington county, a distance of eighteen miles,, 
in order to be married by a Scotch preacher,, 
located at that place in the wilderness. They 
later removed to Hebron, Washington county, 
where he purchased land and became a 
farmer. They later settled in Saratoga 
county, where they reared a family of eight 
children, i. John, moved into the wilds of 
Canada after the last war with England and

(Miller) Laing, was born in Stillwater, Sara- 
toga county. New York, May 15, 1780, died 
in Hebron, New York, September 8, 1859. 
He was a farmer, owning land in Hebron,, 
Washington county. New York. His home- 
stead is still in the possession of his descend- 
ants. While a resident of Wilton, Saratoga 
county, he owned a timber lot and sawmill ; 
he manufactured and dealt in pine lumber, 
rafting it down the river to Albany where he 
found a market for it. At the time of the- 
non-intercourse with England there was a pe- 
riod of dull times, and Mr. Laing tied up- 
his raft at Albany, still continuing to manu- 
facture and log and raft, thinking that in the 
near future times would improve. When the 
embargo was laid and the last war with Eng- 
land was concluded, his debts became so press- 
ing that he was obliged to sell his stock of"

The Nasons were among the 
NASON early settlers of New England, 
and all may be said to trace from 
either Richard, Joseph, John, or Benjamin Na- 
son, who came from Rainsford Island, Eng- 
land, about the year 1648, and settled at South 
Bewick, Maine. They soon became numerous 
and could be found in the other colonies prior 
to the revolution. The definite history of the 
branch begins with

Nicholas Rousseau, the first 
ROUSSEAU of the line here under con- 
sideration of whom we 
have knowledge, emigrated to this country 
from France and landed at Baltimore, Mary- 
land, from whence he removed to Philadel- 
phia, Pennsylvania, and became a dealer in 
■dry goods. He died in the year 1798. He 
was the father of seven sons, four of whom 
came to this country, namely: Achille, John, 
Peter and Alexander. Achille became a 
farmer and resided in Butternuts, near Au- 
burn, New York. John and Peter went to 
Montreal. Intercourse between the brothers 
soon ceased, and little or nothing is known of 
their descendants. 

(II) Alexander, the other son of Nicholas 
Rousseau to come to this country, was born 
in liordeaux, France, May 7, 1766, died in 
Troy, New York, March 2, 1812. He left 
his native land for this country and landed at 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1787. About 
four years later he made his way up the Hud- 
son river as far as Troy, which was then be- 
ginning to shape itself for a village, and was 
•grcatl\- jileased with the place and the pros- 



pect for its future growth. There he made 
the acquaintance of Mary Frear, who was 
born June 12, 1772, and she became his wife 
in 1793. She died in Troy, New York, May

Esaias Warren & Company, continuing after 
the dissolution of that firm, March t, 1827, 
as the senior partner of Rousseau, Richards & 
Company, successors. He was married by 
the Rev. William Butler, of Troy, New York,

(IV) WilHam White, son of Achille J. 
Rousseau, was born in Troy, New York, Sep- 
tember 15, 1838, died in that city January 18, 
1897. He was educated in the city schools 
and for two years was a student at Rensse- 
laer Polytechnic Institute. He engaged in the 
insurance and real-estate business in Troy and 
represented for over twenty-five years a 
prominent New York brokerage house. He 
was for many years closely identified in the 
management of the e.state of N. B. Warren 
& Brothers, later heirs of N. B. Warren, and 
the estate of George Henry Warren. He was 
a capable business man, and large interests 
were committed to his care with the utmost 
security. In 1862 he enlisted in the United 
-States navy and served until the close of the 
civil war. He was prominent in musical cir- 
cles, and the composer of a large amount of 
sacred music, the greater part of it in use 
in the services of the Episcopal church. Rev. 
Dr. John Ireland Tucker, rector of the Church 
of the Holy Cross, founded by Mary Bouton 
\\'arren, widow of Nathan Warren (see War- 
ren family), and Mr. Rousseau collaborated 
in the composition of Episcopal hynmals that

are extensively used throughout the United 
States. These works were "Parish Hym- 
nals," "The Church Hymnal" and "Hymnals 
for Sunday Schools." Mr. Rousseau also 
published (alone) "The Twenty Selections," 
set to Gregorian tunes, and "The Service 
Book." He was organist of the Church of 
the Holy Cross for thirty years, and with Dr. 
Tucker was instrumental in furthering the in- 
troduction of choral music as part of the 
church service, one of the objects which in- 
duced Mrs. Warren to establish the church. 
The experiment met with a large amount of 
opposition, but is now firmly established in all 
Episcopal churches. Mr. Rousseau was a 
member of the Masonic order, and for many 
years served as organist of Mt. Zion and 
Apollo lodges of that order. His political 
preference was for the Republican party, but 
he took no active part in political affairs. He 
was a member and past commander of Gris- 
wold Post, No. 338, Grand Army of tlie Re- 
public.

member of the engineer corps of the United 
States navy, engaged in the construction of 
buildings, dry docks and similar work. His 
success in designing a method for deepening

This familv settled in 
VAN BROCKLIN the Mohawk Valley 

at a date prior to the 
revolution. Tlie records of "New York Sol- 
diers in the Revolution" show many of the 
family to have been engaged in the struggle 
for independence. One of the number. Nicho- 
las, an enlisted member of Captain Jillis Fon- 
da's company of "Associated Exempts" was 
taken prisoner by the Indians and Tories, 
taken into the wilderness and was never heard 
of again. The region in which the family 
settled was the theatre of the operations of 
Brant and the Johnsons and the cruel, re- 
morseless Tories and Indians were only held 
in check by the determined bravery of the 
Mohawk settlers and patriots. The Van 
Brocklin family in the Mohawk Valley was 
founded by two brothers one of whom was 
Gilbert. There were four brothers that came 



from Holland about the year 1730 with their 
sister Barbara. They were Gilbert, Malachi, 
Nicholas and Harpet. Two of the brothers 
never married and from the other two have 
sprung probably all the \'an Brocklins of New 
York state. 

(I) Gilbert Van Brocklin, immigrant an- 
cestor, came from Holland to .America in 
1730 and settled in what is now Montgomery 
county, New York. Pie married and had 
issue. 

(II )_ Gilbert (2), son of Gilbert (i) Van 
Brocklin, was born in 1768, died April 15,, 
1849. He was a farmer of Montgomery 
county, a Whig, and a member of the Lu-

(The Kline Line). 

The question of the nationality of the Kline 
immigrant is not one that has yet been set- 
tled to the unanimous satisfaction of his de- 
scendants. But either Germany or Holland 
is believed to have been his native country. 
The best proof we have at hand that he was 
from I-Iolland is the fact that in his will he 
provided that his large "Dutch Bible" should 
go to a certain son. As he referred to the 
Bible as being "Dutch" it forms a strong pre- 
sumption that he was a Hollander. This will 
was made only a few years before his death. 
William Kline, the emigrant ancestor above 
referred to, was born in 1736, died 1814. He 
emigrated to America when a young man, 
and located in New York City where for a 
time he followed his trade of journeyman 
baker, but in a few years established a busi- 
ness of his own in the same line. He was in 
the baking business in New York at the time 
of his marriage and for a few years thereafter, 
when he sold out and with his young wife set- 
tled in Montgomery county on land he pur- 
chased in what is now Amsterdam township, 
village of Aiken. Here he and his wife 
thereafter lived and died. This was after the 
revolutionary war. On the New York rolls 
of enlisted men in the revolution is the name 
of \\illiam Kline. .\s these rolls were printed 
from old and imperfect lists and spelling was 
often a matter of choice with the writer, it 
establishes as a fact beyond a doubt the tra- 
dition of the family that William served in 
the revolutionary war. (See New York in 
the Revolution, p. 69.) While conducting his 
bakery in New York, William Kline became 
acquainted with and married Mary O'Reagcn, 
born in Ireland in 1740, died in NIontgomery

The earliest Lyon emigrant of 
LYON whom we have positive knowl- 
edge was William Lyon, who 
came to Roxbury, Massachusetts, in 1635 on 
the shi]), "Hopewell." He founded a numer- 
ous family, of whom a distinguished member 
was Nathaniel Lvon, a general in the LInion 
army, killed at the battle of Balls Bluff. The 
next immigrants were two brothers, Peter and 
George, of Dorchester, Massachusetts. In 
1644 Richard Lyon was sent from England 
to Cambridge, Massachusetts, by Sir Henry 
Mildmay as a tutor for his son William. He, 
however, soon returned to England. About 
1648 there appeared in Fairfield county, Con- 
necticut, at about the same time, three settlers 
bearing the name Lyon. One of these, 
Thomas, was the founder of the family herein 
recorded, whose principal seat in the early 
days was Westchester county. New York. 

(I) Thomas Lyon, "of Rye," was born in 
England about 1621, died at Byram Neck, 
Greenwich, Fairfield county, Connecticut, in 
1690, and was buried in the old Lyon bury- 
ing ground at that place. It is supposed that 
he first settled in Massachusetts and from 
there removed to the western part of Fair- 
field county, where about the same time Rich- 
ard and Henry appeared, presumably his 
brothers or cousins. In 1652 Thomas Lyon 
bought a house and lot in .Stamford of Wil- 
liam Potter. In 1654 he purchased a house 
and lot in Fairfield. Between these dates his 
first wife Martha Johanna (Winthrop) Lyon, 
died. In 1676, in company with John Banks, 
of "Fayrefield," he acquired title to a "Sar- 
taine parsell of land in Greenwich, lying by 
Byram River and by estimation three score 
ackers." In the records of Rye under date 
of March 5, 1676, is this entry: "The towne 
of Rye (New York) adopted the following: 
Thomas Lyon and Thomas Brown are ap- 
pointed to choose a house or place to be forti- 
fied for safety of the towne." Winthrop says 
that it is believed that it was this Thomas 
Lyon who served as a colonial soldier from 
Connecticut, although this supposition would 
make him either very young at time of serv- 
ice, or quite old at the date of his first mar- 
riage. His will was dated December 6, 1689, 
and probated at Fairfield, September 7, iTiqo. 
During the latter years of his life, altliough 
probably living in Greenwich at Byram Neck, 
Thomas Lyon was spoken of as "of Rye," this 
place being in New York just across Byram 
river, now called Port Chester. The name 
Lyon's Point, written also, Lion's Point, ap- 
plied to the point at the mouth of Byram river, 
was in common use as early as 1683. Thomas 
was a member of the Society of Friends and 



suffered some persecution for his belief. He 
married (first) Alartha Johanna \\'inthrop, 
a granddaughter of Governor John Winthrop, 
of Salem, Massachusetts, and daughter of 
Henry and Elizabeth (Fones ) Winthrop. Her 
father was drowned in Boston harbor, July 
2, 1630, the day after his arrival. His wife 
remained in England when her husband came 
to America, coming with her infant daughter 
in 1631. Martha was born in Groton Manor, 
England, May 9, 1630, died in Stamford, Con- 
necticut, about 1653. Thomas Lyon married 
(second) about 1654, Mary, daughter of Si- 
mon Hoyt, of Stamford, Connecticut. Chil-

(II) Thomas (2), son of Thomas (i) and 
Mary (Hoyt) Lyon, was born at Greenwich, 
Connecticut, in 1673, died 1739. He built the 
house near Byram bridge which is still stand- 
ing, having been occupied continuously until 
the present time by his descendants. He was 
a member of Colonel Robert Hunter's com- 
pany of Fusileers, mustered in New York and 
Westchester counties, February 24, 171 1, for 
sixty-one days' service on the Canadian fron- 
tier. His will, dated April 2, 1739, was proved 
at .Stamford, Connecticut, May i, 1739. He 
married Abigail, daughter of John Ogden, of 
.Stamford, Connecticut. John Ogden came to 
Stamford from Long Island in 1641. In 1642 
he agreed with Governor Kieft to build a 
stone church for twenty-five hundred guild- 
ers. He returned to Hempstead in 1644 and 
was one of the patentees of that town. In 
165 1 he removed to Southampton, Long 
Island, where he was chosen assistant and 
named in the Royal Charter. Later he went 
to New Jersey with Governor Carteret and 
was representative from Elizabethtown in the 
first general assembly, 1689. He married

(VIII) Irving Whitall Lyon, M. D., son of 
Solomon R. and Hannah (Rundle) Lyon, was 
born in Bedford, Westchester county. New 
York, in 1840, died in Hartford, Connecticut, 
March 4, 1896. He received a good education 
and chose medicine as his profession. He 
entered the College of Physicians and Sur- 
geons, New York City, where he received his 
degree of M.D. He established in practice at 
Hartford, Connecticut, continuing until his 
death. Although a learned and skillful physic- 
ian he is perhaps better known and remem- 
bered as an authority on American antiques. 
His work on "Colonial Furniture," published 
in 189 1, was the pioneer work of its kind, and 
although two decades have passed since it was 
published, it is an unquestioned authority, and 
subsef|uent writers have not changed a date 
nor controverted any statement of fact in the 
work. It is a classic and an infallible guide. 
Another work of Dr. Lyon's on which he was 
engaged at the time of his death was, "Colon- 
ial Architecture of America," being uncom- 
pleted ; this was never published. Wherever 



his name is known and spoken, he is referred 
to always as "the father of American an- 
tiques." He was president of the Hartford 
Medical Society, member of the State Medical 
Society, and a member of the Connecticut His- 
torical Society. He was a Christian without 
a creed and of so pure and blameless a life 
that death brought him no fear. He was just 
to all men, kind and unfailingly courteous, a 
man of the highest ideals, which he did not 
fail to attain in his daily life. As a physician 
he was beloved and trusted. Dr. Lyon mar- 
ried Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Frederick 
Darrow and Louise (Jacobs) Tucker, of New 
York state. Children: i. Mary Phillips, mar- 
ried Chester B. Albree, of Pittsburg, North 
Side. Pennsylvania. 2. Irving Phillips, a well- 
established, skillful physician of Buffalo, Ne\\- 
York. 3. Charles W.. of further mention. 

(IX) Charles Woolsey, youngest son of Dr. 
Irving \\'. and Mary E. (Tucker) Lyon, was 
born in Hartford, Connecticut, December 10, 
1862. at No. 27 Buckingham street. He was 
educated in the common schools of Hartford, 
then entered Hartford high school, where he 
prepared for college. He entered Sheffield Sci- 
entific School (Yale University) in the second 
year, but before graduation received so flat- 
tering and tempting a business oft'er that he 
did not stay to finish the full course. He had 
inherited his father's love of the antique, and 
had sat under his teaching so effectively that 
although a young man he had an established 
reputation among collectors. His ability to 
distinguish the rare, beautiful and valuable at- 
tracted the attention of the famous collector of 
American antiques, Charles H. Taylor, of 
Boston, who engaged him to travel and buy 
for his private collection, one of the most 
valuable in the United States if not in the 
world. For four years he traveled for Mr. 
Taylor in New England and through the Hud- 
son-Mohawk valleys, finding the latter espe- 
cially rich in the rare and valuable of a long 
ago period. In 1903 he began collecting for 
the public and opened a store at No. 47 Wash- 
ington avenue, later removing to the corner of 
South Hawk street and Washington avenue, 
Albany, where his store has become the mecca 
of American collectors of the antique. He is 
a member of the Chi Phi (Yale Chapter) and 
the University Club, of .Albany.

The earliest Stroud record is 
STROUD of Jacob Stroud, of Amwell, 

New Jersey, 1735. He with 
three brothers entered the provincial army 
and were at the battles of Fort William Henry 
and Quebec, where Jacob Stroud, John F'ish 
and Matthias Hutchinson, being the three sol- 
diers nearest General Wolfe when he fell, car- 
ried him to a sheltered spot where he died. 
One of the Stroud brothers was killed on the 
"Plains of Abraham" during the battle. Ja- 
cob Stroud returned to New Jersey and later 
settled in Pennsylvania, where he founded the 
town of .Stroudsburg. He afterward fought 
in the war of the revolution, became a colonel 
in rank, commanded at Fort Penn, and was a 
member of the constitutional convention that 
framed the first constitution of the state of 
Pennsylvania. He died 1806 and was then the 
owner of four thousand acres of land in and 
around Stroudsburg. Nothing definite seems 
to be known of the other two surviving broth- 
ers. They evidently settled in Massachusetts, 
as four of that name served in the revolution- 
ary war from that state. George. Prince, Wil- 
liam of Sherburne, and another William. The 
family in Ballston Spa, New York, descends 
from one of the two brothers before men- 
tioned.

The first account we have 
DORR AN CE of the Dorrance family in 

America tells that on April 
17, 1723, the people of Voluntown, Connecti- 
cut, gave Rev. Samuel Dorrance a call to 
preach the Gospel at a salary of "£60 per year 
for the present and £50 in such species suit- 
able to promote his building and settling." 
On the same day a number of persons "as a 
special token of their love and goodness" pre- 
sented Rev. Dorrance with "five thousand 
■shingles, three pounds money in shingle nails, 
five pounds in work, three pounds in boards 
and plank, two hundred clapboards, breaking 
up two acres of land, a cow and a calf." The 
Voluntown church was the first, and long the 
only Presbyterian church in Connecticut. The 
adoption of the Westminster Confession by 
the new church caused immediate rebellion, 
and a determined effort was mafle to j^revent 
the ordination of Rev. Dorrance. These pro- 
tests, in part, made to the council cjuotes : "We 
protest against settling Mr. Dorrance because 
he is a stranger and we are informed he came 
out of Ireland, and we do observe that since 
he has been in town the Irish do flock to town 
and we are informed the Irish are not whole- 
some inhabitants and upon this account we 
are against settling Mr. Dorrance, for we are 
not such persons as you take us to be, but 
desire the Gospel to be preached by one of 
■our own and not by a stranger, for we cannot 
•receive anv benefit for neither soul nor body 



and we would pray him to withdraw himself 
from us." The council took all day to hear 
the case which they decided for both parties. 
The good minister, however, was ordained 
December 23, 1723. He is found in the 
ministry of Voluntown in the year 1760, and 
drawing a salary of £300. He died Novem- 
ber 12, 1775, at the age of ninety. Two of his 
sons, John and George, settled in the Wyom- 
ing Valley. Pennsylvania. George was lieu- 
tenant-colonel of militia and third in com- 
mand of the battle of W'yoming, where he was 
wounded, and on July 4, 1778, slain by his In- 
dian captors. His descendants have been in- 
fluential citizens of the valley, where they fig- 
ure largely in political, financial and military 
records. . Through the intermarriage of the 
Dorrance and Fox families, the family line 
can be traced to 1653 in ]\Iassachusetts, and 
1723 in Connecticut. A connection cannot be 
made between Alexander, of Hampton. Con- 
necticut, and Rev. Samuel, but there is no 
doubt he was a great-grandson. Another in- 
termarriage was with the McBurneys of 
county Antrim, Ireland. Eliza McBurney 
was a daughter of James, of the north of Ire- 
land. She and two brothers came to America. 
Eliza married James A. Dorrance, while the 
brothers cannot be definitely traced. One of 
them, Thomas, enlisted in the Union army and 
died in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1862. The 
other, James, went west and died in Elko, 
Nevada. The Young family is also one of 
the old and prominent Troy families. The 
family in Troy was founded by James Alex- 
ander Dorrance of New England birth, and 
early of Hampton, Connecticut. 

(I) Alexander Dorrance was born in Con- 
necticut, died at Chaplin, Connecticut, Sep- 
tember IT. 1870. He was a shoemaker of 
Hampton. He married, April 25, 1825, Mary 
Lucretia Fox, born at Woodstock, Connecti- 
cut, November t6, 1801. and accidentally 
killed by being thrown from her carriage 
while returning from church, September 9, 
1849. She was a daughter of William and 
Mary (Coburn) Fox, of Woodstock, Con- 
necticut, and a lineal descendant in the seventh 
generation from Thomas Fox, the immigrant 
ancestor, who was of Cambridge, Massachu- 
setts, in 1638, and one of the original pro- 
prietors of that town then called Newton. 
They resided at Woodstock, Connecticut, for 
about ten years after marriage, then at Can- 
terbury and Scotland of the same state. Later 
they returned to Hampton, where Mrs. Dor- 
rance was killed. Children: i. James Alex-

(H) Abram R., son of Peter and Mary A. 
(Brown) Close, was born in ALiyfield, Fulton 
county. New York, September i6, 1827. died 
December 27, 1900. He received a good edu- 
cation and at tbe age of eighteen began to 
learn the art and trade of glovemaking. 
About 185 1 he engaged in mercantile pursuits 
and for half a century was a merchant of 
. ^^ayf^eld. His first partner was John Rrown, 
later Amos Christie, the firm being Close & 
Christie. In 1869 they engaged in the manu- 
facture of gloves and mittens and continued in 
successful operation until the death of Mr. 
Close. In 1887 their store was destroyed by 
fire, but was at once replaced with a large 
brick block accommodating store and factory. 
After the death of Mr. Close this block was 
sold to Eugene Heacock. He was a most suc- 
cessful business man and stood high in the 
commercial world. He was constantly in the 
service of the public. For thirty-three years 
he was postmaster of Mayfield, and for seven- 
teen years justice of the peace and notary 
public. He was Republican in politics, always 
taking an active part. He was a member of 
the Society of Friends, his wife being a Meth- 
odist. He died very suddenly and was sin- 
cerely mourned. He married, January 5, 
1852, Harriet, born December 3, 1828, daugh- 
ter of John and Mary A. (Woodworth) Hol- 
lenbeck. She survives him, a resident of 
Mayfield. Children: i. Mary A., born De- 
cember 25, 1857, died October 9, 1894; mar- 
ried George M. Woodworth. 2. John P.,

mate; child, Mary Inez. 3. Hattie J., born

Harriet (Hollenbeck) Close descends from 
Peter Hollenbeck, of Holland. The name is 
variously spelled Hallenbeck. Hollenbeck, 
Hellenbeck, etc. Peter was a shoemaker; 
married Alma Fonda and had an only son, 
John, who was a farmer, school teacher and no- 
tary public, transacting business for the entire 
community. His father, Peter, was a Presby- 
terian and many of the family were Friends. 
John was a Christian and lived an honorable, 
manly life but was not connected with any 
special denomination. He married Mary, 
daughter of Sela and Rebecca (Dcenham) 
Woodworth. John and Mary Hollenbeck had 
four children: i. John, married Hannah 
Brownell and had Horace and Frank, who 
survive, five being dead. 2. Mary Ann, mar- 
ried Orville Brown : children : Edward, Har- 
riet, married Granville Baker, Sela, married 
Brown Hollenbeck, George. 3. Harriet, mar- 
ried Abram B. Close. 4. Sela, married Caro- 
line Dennv. 



Sela Woodworth, maternal grandfather of 
Harriet (Hollenbeck) Close, came to May- 
field during the troublous Indian times during 
the revolution and took up land near the fort 
that stood on the present site of the Johnstowrr 
jail, seeking the shelter of the fort when dan- 
ger threatened. His father was killed by In- 
dians who shot him from ambush. Sela's 
wife, Rebecca, shared these dangers with him 
and on one occasion fled with her babe in 
arms to the sheltering forest, leaving the 
house which a band of Indians was approach- 
ing. They tried to fire the house but failed. 
Her father, Ebenezer. was killed by Indians 
while plowing in his fields. They cut otT his 
head and fastened it to the horns of the oxen, 
who came home to be fed bearing their 
ghastly burden and the first news to the fam- 
ily that the father and husband was dead. But 
these times of danger passed and in quieter 
time Sela Woodworth reared his family. He- 
was a good man as well as a brave one and 
became one of Mayfield's leading men. He 
donated the ground on which the Mayfield- 
church is built, and there his granddaughter, 
Mrs. Close, has erected a tablet to his memory. 
Among her treasures is a clock owned by Sela 
that passed through the perilous times re- 
corded. Mrs. Close has long since passed her 
allotted "three score years and ten" and is al- 
most the last of her generation. She inherited 
the vigor, tenacity and brave spirit of her pio- 
neer ancestors, who amid scenes of peril and 
death laid broad and deep the foundations for 
the prosperity that now surrounds her. 



The first of the Keck family of 
KECK which there is record in Fulton 
county. New York, is George 
Keck, a farmer of the county. He married' 
Catherine Coughnet and had twelve children:

abeth, Isaac (see forward), Peter, Joseph,

1814, and died there. He was reared on the- 
farm and given a good common school educa- 
tion. He remained with his parents on the- 
farm until arriving at man's estate. He then 
settled on a farm of his own near Keek's Cen- 
ter. Fulton county, where he lived the re- 
mainder of his days. He married. October 
15, 1836, Eliza .'\. Burns, born February 13,

turned to Johnstown and began studies pre- 
paratory to the profession of law, which he 
had decided to follow. He attended Clinton 
Liberal Institute and Whitetown Seminary. 
After completing his preparatory studies he 
read law with Judge John ^^'ells and James 
M. Dudley, entering their offices for that pur- 
pose in April. 1868. Having passed a suc- 
cessful examination he was admitted to the 
bar at the general term of the supreme court 
held at Schenectady, .-\pril 8, 1869. He was 
at once admitted to a partnership with his 
preceptors, becoming junior member of the 
law firm of ^^'ells, Dudley & Keck. This firm 
continued in successful practice until the dis-- 
solution in 1877. He then entered into a part- 
nership with his brother, and as J. & P. Keck 
transacted a successful legal business until 
1883. He was elected district attorney of the 
county in 1874, and re-elected in 1877. I" 
1883 he was elected county judge and surro- 
gate, and held those offices for eighteen years, 
imtil such offices were separated a little over 
nine years ago. He has held the office of 
surrogate ever since, with an unexpired term 
of three years to serve. 

A\'hile prominent as a lawyer and successful 
in private practice. Judge Keck is best known 
in his public capacities as district attorney, 
county judge and surrogate, covering a pub- 
lic service of nearly thirty-six years. During 
this long term of service he has been many 
times before the voters of Fulton county as 
their candidate, and rarely had opposition 
from the opposing party. His nominations 
bave nearly always been made by acclamation 
and re-election without opposition— a tribute 
rarely paid to any man. During his profes- 
sional career he has been connected with most 
of the important litigation of the county, both 
civil and criminal. He has always been 
known as an able, upright and conscientious 
lawyer, taking rank with the ablest members 
of the Fulton county bar. As judge and sur- 
rogate he has been fair and impartial, rapidly 
transacting the business before him, ruling 
-with such accuracy and fairness that there 
have been very few reversals of his decisions 
when reviewed by the higher courts. He is 
held in high esteem by bis .brethren of the 
profession as a jurist, and by the people gener- 
ally as a good friend and neighbor. He has 
always been a student, and has a fine law li- 
brary, including law works issued in London 
over two and a half centuries ago. 

Judge Keck is known as a forcible speaker 
before a jury and in the argument of causes, 
and of very pleasing address on subjects out- 
side of his professional work. When a young 
man be constantly received flattering press no- 



tices in their reports of Memorial Day ad- 
dresses and other occasions of patriotic com- 
memoration. In 1889 he delivered a brief ad- 
dress at the dedication of a monument to his 
old regiment at Gettysburg. Pennsylvania, 
which though impromptu was widely reported 
and greatly admired, and will be found in the 
work entitled "New York at Gettysburg"' re- 
cently issued by the state of New York. This 
address shows his readiness and ability to 
speak without previous preparation. He said : 

"Nothing new can be said and nothing new need 
be sought, for the greatness of the struggle and tlie 
grandeur of the victory are more appreciated as 
they are more studied and better understood. And 
so it will be while patriotism dwells in the hearts 
of the American people. What was done here was 
not done for that day and tiine, but for all days and 
for all times. When the martyred Lincoln here 
expressed the hope that the result of the great con- 
flict might be 'that government of the people, by the 
people, and for the people, shall not perish from the 
earth,' the dark clouds of war rolled over and en- 
shrouded the land. That hope has been triumph- 
antly fulfilled. Not only has this government been 
established, but before the eyes of all other nations 
has a grand proof been given of the permanence of 
free institutions and the power of an intelligent and 
devoted people to maintain the stability of their 
country in times of the greatest trial. ' Times of 
trial and danger may come upon the nation, very 
different from those we commemorate and yet very 
great, and when those times do come we believe it 
is not in vain to hope that the memory of . this 
struggle will encourage and anitiiate the hearts of 
her citizens to maintain that union which has been 
purchased with so much blood. We felt that our 
country was at stake, but the nations of the civ- 
ilized world felt that something still greater was 
imperilled— the principle that a Republic could by 
the devotion of her citizens save her national life 
in the greatest struggle that has as yet been re- 
corded in the history of the world. We, my com- 
rades, who have done what we could, here in tjie 
time of our country's need, now do this, as the last 
permanent thing that we can do. for we shall soon 
pass away to join our comrades and our names will 
be forgotten, but the work we have done will live 
for us, and this monument will speak for us to the 
generations to come, and tell where the Remis 
Heights battalion stood, in this harvest field of 
death." 

His pa])er on the life of Sir William John- 
son, prejjared for and read before the State 
Historical Association in 1903, and after- 
wards published in its records, and his recent 
address on behalf of the members of the 
Grand Army of the Republic at the dedication 
of the Soldiers' Monument of Johnstown, 
October 5, 1910, in the presentation of such 
monument to the city, have been regarded as 
worthy of the occasions. 

For fourteen years Judge Keck has been 
and still is a member of the executive com- 
mittee of the State Bar Association, and also

The family name of Peltz is 

I'F,LTZ derived from the German, and 

signifies hides, pelts or skins of 

animals, and was originally applied to a hunter

or else one who dealt in these. For the first 
one Inindred years in Albany, at the time 
when the place was known as Beaverwyck, 
Fort Orange and Rensselaerwyck, the chief 
men of the colony were engaged in the hunt- 
ing and traffic of beaver and other skins, and 
by this means made their fortunes which en- 
titled them to be classed among the wealthy 
and most respected merchants or burghers of 
the settlement in the wilderness. So promi- 
nent was the trade that the skins of any num- 
ber of animals passed current as money, and 
the ancient trading-books of some of these 
old burghers show that they kept their ac- 
counts in a peculiar, pictorial fashion, to be 
understood by the Indians with whom they 
dealt, and in them the column of figures gave 
way to lines of rude sketches of various skins, 
for each variety had its special value. 

The progenitor of the Peltz family in 
America was John Peltz, who came to this 
country from Hesse, in Germany, and settled 
first in Philadelphia. He had had his own 
convictions in the other country about affairs 
of that period, and to stand by these and not 
be enrolled in the army in opposition to his 
principles, he was forced to locate elsewhere, 
hence he selected this country as a refuge, as 
had hundreds of others who sought relief 
from religious persecutions abroad. He was 
born May 19, 1714, died November 19, 1791. 
He married, while in Germany, Gertrude 
Grau. She was born in that country, 1717,

looked after the welfare of his brothers and 
sisters. He was a minister of the Dutch Re- 
formed church, and officiated first at Coey- 
mans, then at New Paltz, also at Paterson, 
New Jersey, and other places. He became 
secretary of the board of missions. Ill health, 
before reaching advanced age, caused him to 
retire from active engagements, and he re- 
turned to his Coeymans home, where he lived 
an estimable life for the remainder of his 
days. He married (first) at Philadelphia, 
Annie Sailor. He married (second) at Al- 
bany, March 17, 1852, Mary De Witt. She 
was born in Albany, February 19, 1819, died 
there January 15, 1903. She had married

who died aged fifteen months, and Sarah, who 
died the day of her birth. She was the daugh- 
ter of Rev. John and Sarah (Schoonmaker) 
De Witt. 

Rev. John De Witt was born December 15. 
1788, died at Albany. October 11. 1831. and 
was the son of John I. and Mary (Breestede) 
De Witt. He was a man of varied scholarly 
attainments and of versatile talents. It is 
said that he was acquainted with nine lan- 
guages, among them Hebrew and Arabic. He 
was graduated at Rutgers College. New 
Brunswick, New Jersey, and at the New- 
Brunswick Theological Seminary. He was 
much dcvntcd to botany and had considerable

musical talent. He was an eloquent public 
sj^eaker ; was of fine personal appearance, 
somewhat over medium height, and had a re- 
markably handsome head and face, as may be 
seen from his portrait, the original of which, 
painted in oil, is in Rutgers College. He had 
a cheerful temperament, high spirits and gen- 
ial social qualities. It is a tradition in the 
family that his father had intended that he 
should be a lawyer, but he himself felt his 
vocation to be the ministry. In 1814 he ac- 
cepted a call to the pastorate of the Reformed 
Dutch church of Albany, which was then 
what was styled a "Collegiate Church," a sys- 
tem, in accordance with the custom in the 
larger cities in the United Netherlands, of hav- 
ing under one organization two or more 
church buildings with as many pastors as 
there were houses of worship, they officiating 
alternately in the different church buildings. 
The Albany church was, in the early part of 
the nineteenth century, the most important in 
the denomination outside the city of New 
York, as Albany was the city of second size 
and importance in the state. There were, in 
1814. two houses of worship belonging to the 
Albany Collegiate Church, one on the west 
side of North Pearl street, corner of Orange, 
finished in 1798, and the other on a large lot 
extending from Hudson avenue to Beaver 
street, east of Pearl street, completed in 1810. 
The latter edifice was an imitation of the 
Church of St. Alartin's-in-the-Field, London, 
designed by Sir Christopher Wren, and was 
regarded (razed about 1890) as a fine exam- 
ple of church architecture. When Rev. John 
De Witt became pa.stor in 1814, the Rev. John 
M. Bradford, D.D., was his colleague. In 
181 5 the collegiate form of pastorate was dis- 
continued, a new corporation was formed for 
the more southerly church, and the landed 
property of the old corporation, which was 
considerable, was divided into two equal 
parts, each of the church organizations taking 
one part. It was determined by lot which of 
the two pastors should take the north and 
which the .south church, and the result was 
that John De Witt became the first sole pastor 
of the South Church, then so called, and Dr. 
Bradford sole pastor of the North Church. 
On account of the population moving wester- 
ly, a new edifice was erected on Madison ave- 
nue, to which the congregation removed in 
1881. and the old building sold for mercan- 
tile purposes. In the interior of the new 
church was erected a marble tablet to his 
memory and also one in the Dutch Church of 
Kew Brunswick, where he was liuried. the 
latter reading: "To the Memory of the Rev. 
John De Witt, D.l).. Professor of Sacred 



Literature and Biblical Criticism in the 
Theological Seminary of the Reformed Dutch 
Church, and of Logic and Belles Lettres in 
Rutgers College, who, after discharging the 
duties of a Christian Pastor with much zeal 
and success, during several years at Albany, 
entered September, 1823, upon his Profes- 
sional Labour, which he executed with dis- 
tinguished ability, and died Oct. 11, A.D. 
1831, aged 41 years and 10 months. This 
monument, erected by the general synod of 
the Reformed Dutch church, is designed to 
express their high regard for the Deceased.

can well remember his features. He had the 
most commanding and noblest physiognomy 
of any De Witt I have ever seen, — when once 
seen, never to be forgotten. He was a very 
intellectual man ; owned a sloop which he used 
in the transportation business on the Hudson 
River ; made money rapidly, and at last sold 
his slooj), and purchased property, mills and 
farms at Catskill, N. Y. This was of course

called "Captain" and was captain of a mili- 
tary company during the revolution, which 
served for the special purpose of protection 
of the Kingston district, of whom his grand- 
son. Simeon P. De Witt, writes: "He be- 
came conspicuous as a captain of infantry 
under Colonel Pawling in the Northern Divis- 
ion of the American Army in the war of '76. 
At the death of his colonel, he acted in that 
ca])acity through the war. at the taking of

nounced interest in that institution's welfare. 
The directors of the National Commercial 
Bank resolved: "For many years a member 
of the executive committee, no one was more 
faithful in attendance, more willing to apply 
his labors and influence in its behalf. His 
record in this city is one worthy of emula- 
tion and his life's history may well stand as 
an encouraging example to the young men of 
this day and generation. Depending upon his 
own efforts and exertions, he was a generous 
and helpful friend, responding to the great 
confidence placed in him. and was at the head 
of our largest business concerns."

ine Walsh, born in Albany and also residing 
there in 191 1. 

(The W'alsh Line). 

Dudley \\'alsh was the progenitor of this 
family in America. He was born in Dublin 
in 1756, and came to this country soon after 
the revolution, settling in Albany, New York, 
where he was a general merchant, and died 
there May 24, 1816. He formed the firm of 
Walsh & Staats, which dealt in domestic prod- 
ucts, imported articles and landed property. 
Transportation in this state was in a very 
primitive condition in those days, large wag- 
ons and sloops being used instead of steam- 
boats and rail lines. Their business grew 
rapidly, and becoming extensive, his brother 
Charles joined him, but died after a few years' 
residence. His sister Alice, who lived near 
Dublin, died unmarried, and another sister 
married an officer in the British army, named 
Palmer, who was killed in the battle of New 
Orleans. 

Dudley Walsh was a faithful member of St. 
Peter's Episcopal Church at Albany. His 
sagacity, energy and integrity rendered his 
business career very prosperous, and he closed 
his life with the record of ranking among the 
most prominent merchants in this country. 
He had often to contend against adverse con- 
ditions, but his great ability enabled him to 
surmount all obstacles. On the retirement of 
Mr. Staats from their business, he took into 
partnership Harry Beekman, of New York 
City, and for many years had branch offices 
there in lower Broadway, as well as in Al- 
bany, doing much banking business and being 
well known in London. The late Myndert 
\'an Schaick, president of the Croton Aque- 
duct board, said he was one of the first men 
in this country. He was president of the Bank 
of Albany, the earliest institution of the kind 
in that city. He loaned large sums of money 
to General Stephen Van Rensselaer, the last 
Patroon. He was a contributor to the found- 
ing of Union College in 1795, and also con- 
tributed to the founding of the Albany Boys' 
Academy. He imported his carriage from 
London, and his porcelain was brought from 
China by Captain Stewart Dean aboard his 
sailing vessel, which was the first to engage 
in traffic with that distant country, sailing 
around "the Horn." This rare and beautiful 
old china is preserved with reverence by the 
family, as is the Napoleon clock brought from 
Paris and the celebrated Walsh wine from 
Madeira. He advanced to Sir William Poult- 
ney, afterward Earl of Bath, about twenty 
thousand English pounds sterling, to finance 
his land purchases in this country, and had 
much difficulty and considerable delay in get- 



ting his money back at a discount from that 
shrewd and eccentric man. 

Dudley Walsh married, Albany, New York, 
September 24, 1793, Sarah Stevenson, born 
at Albany, September 25, 1772, died at the 
Manor House of General Pierre \'an Cort- 
landt, at Croton-on-Hudson, June 22, 1816, and 
her body was brought to Albany in a sloop- 
for burial there in the Stevenson vault. Sarah 
Stevenson's parents were John and Magda- 
lena (Douw) Stevenson. John Stevenson- 
was born in Albany, March 13, 1735, died 
there April 24, 18 10. He was the first presi- 
dent of the Albany St. Andrew's Society, 
organized October 19, 1803, composed of 
Scotchmen of good standing in the commun- 
ity. Upon his coat-of-arms, displayed on a- 
copper plate, a gold seal and an old silver 
salver, still in possession of his descendants, 
appears the pious legend : Coelum non solum ; 
Heaven, not Earth. John Stevenson was a 
neighbor of Philip Livingston, the Signer, 
living on State street prior to the revolution, 
and tenants in common of an estate of more 
than eight thousand acres on the Mohawk, 
called Lilac's Bush. The original deed of 
Livingston to Stevenson for half of this prop- 
erty was in the famous autograph collection' 
of the late Rev. Dr. William Buel Sprague. 
He also owned other large tracts of land,, 
and a curious record in his family Bible sets 
forth that some of his male slaves ran away 
and one was incarcerated. His earlier mar- 
ried career was clouded by the loss of several' 
of his children, but despite all adversities he 
was known as a man of engaging character 
and well-beloved by brother Scotchmen. His 
sister married General Gabriel Christie, of 
Montreal, who had a seigneurie near Rouse- 
Point, New York. His .son, James Stevenson, 
was born at Albany, November 25, 1788, died 
there, unmarried, July 3, 1852, and was the 
thirty-sixth mayor of Albany, officiating 
twice, 1826 and 1827, when he resigned office.. 
His son was a warden of St. Peter's Chiu-ch, 
trustee of Albany Boys' .Academy, one of the 
first governors of the Albany Hospital, a man 
of wealth and a polished gentleman. One of 
John Stevenson's daughters married General 
Pierre Van Cortlandt, a patriot of the revolu- 
tion, and known widely as one of nature's 
noblemen. John Stevenson married. Albany, 
August 30, 1770, Magdalena Douw, born May

business, but .soon retired and removed to 
Mulberry Hill, at Normansville, Albany 
county, which had been the residence of Mrs. 
Walsh's grandfather, Judge Ambrose Spen- 
cer, who was also mayor of Albany. About 
five years before his death he came back to 
Albany. He was kind, generous and manly, 
his sympathies ever alive to the wants of the 
suffering. He was the kindly, cordial host at 
many an entertainment, and he lived a life 
of purity and benevolence. In the latter years 
of his life a German wished to repay him a 
loan of two hundred dollars made some thirty 
years previous. Afr. Walsh had intended it 
as a gift and did not recognize his caller. The 



latter requested him to examine his books and 
receive the four hundred dollars which had 
brought him wealth and he was glad to be 
able to repay it.

^largaret, his wife, died July 20, 1825. 

(II) James, son of James B. and Mar- 
garet (Townsend) Gibson, was born at Salem, 
New York, September 5, 1816. He was eleven 
years old when his father died, leaving his 
•children little beyond his good name and ex- 
ample. James was educated at Washington 
Academy, Salem, and while yet a student en- 
tered the law office of his uncle, Samuel Stev- 
■ens, a former partner of his father, at the 
time an eminent practitioner and later a lead- 
ing member of the Albany bar. He studied 
after his uncle's departure with Cyrus Stev- 
■ens, of Salem, and later with John H. Boyd, 
•of Whitehall. In 1836, at the October term 
of the supreme court, he was admitted to the 
"bar. He formed a partnership with Cyrus 
Stevens which continued one year and until 
the latter removed to Albany. From that 
time forward Mr. Gibson practiced his pro- 
fession alone and in his native town, Salem. 

He was successful from the beginning. His 
•qualifications were such as to attract the at- 
tention of the public and in a short time he 
■commanded an extensive practice. Many im- 
portant cases were committed to his care, in- 
volving novel questions, requiring deep re- 
search into the principles and logic of law and 
the science of jurisprudence. The first case 
lie tried which was carried to the supreme 
■court on appeal and in which he prepared the 
argument was that of Prindle vs. Anderson 
(Reported in 19 Wend, 391). This was a 
case in which he raised and succeeded in the 
contention that the receipt of rent by land- 
lord, after service by him of notice to quit on 
his tenant, was a waiver of the notice. This 
decision was affirmed in the court for the cor- 
rection of errors. In the case of Shaw vs. 
Beveridge (3 Hill, 26), he succeeded in estab- 
lishing as law, that an action of trespass 
would he, for disturbing a party in possession 



of a pew in church. In Stevenson vs. Bar- 
din, tried in i860, the court held that on his 
motion that photographs of an instrument 
alleged to be forged could be used to estab- 
lish such forgery. As this was the first at- 
tempt to use photography in the courts the 
decision was of general interest. After 1853 
I\lr. Gibson was largely engaged in railroad 
suits and became attorney for the Boston 
Hoosac Tunnel and Western Railway Com- 
pany in several important cases, notably, re- 
opening the Albany Northern railroad. 

.\fter becoming a voter, Mr. Gibson became 
an active Whig, later joining the Republican 
party. In 1838 he assumed the editorial chair 
of the li'asluni:;ton County Post, at Salem, 
and continued as editor through the presiden- 
tial campaign of 1840, and until January i, 
1841, when he sold the paper. At the first 
judicial election after the adoption of the con- 
stitution of 1846, he was nominated by the 
Whigs as a candidate for justice of the su- 
preme court. One of his associates on the 
ticket was Daniel Cady, of Fulton county, 
who was the only candidate elected. Mr. Gib- 
son ran over a thousand votes ahead of his 
ticket but was defeated, his connection with 
the Independent Order of Odd Fellows oper- 
ating against him, the feeling against secret 
societies being very strong. In November, 
1850, he was elected judge of Washington 
county, serving four years with great honor 
and usefulness. In November, 1866, he was 
elected state senator from the twelfth sena- 
torial district composed of the counties of 
Rensselaer and Washington. He was well 
known and was placed at the head of com- 
mittee on claims and on the judiciary commit- 
tee. He accepted the chairmanship of claims 
with reluctance, knowing the pressure that 
would be brought to bear on him to report 
favorably in iniquitous claims. He served, 
however, during his entire term : examined 
and passed on claims against the state aggre- 
gating over one million dollars and with few 
and meritorious exceptions, rejected them, in 
which course he was sustained by the senate. 
He made a strong effort to have the Cham- 
plain canal enlarged from Troy to White- 
hall, had his bill passed in the senate but the 
house rejected it. He was a member of the 
senate when George W. Smith, of Oneida 
county, was tried by the senate for various 
crimes and misdemeanors. He voted to re- 
move Judge Smith and in his speech explain- 
ing his vote, said, "Tlie land wants such as 
dare, with vigor, execute the laws." He took 
a very active part in legislation in the senate : 
made several sijeeches and in every way did 
his full dutv as a senator. He was an active 



HUDSON AND :yiOHA\VK VALLEYS 



Republican until 187 1, when he became a Lib- 
eral and later became identified with the Dem- 
ocratic party. He was always interested in 
military affairs. In 1840 he raised and was 
made captain of a company of light infantry 
attached by special order to the Fiftieth Regi- 
ment in the state militia. Later he was com- 
missioned major and lieutenant-colonel, on 
the disbanding of the Fiftieth he was attached 
to the Thirtieth Regiment and promoted to 
the colonelcy of that regiment. During the 
civil war the Thirtieth was twice filled up by 
draft in readiness for service, many of the 
members volunteering into the United States 
service. In 1867 he became brigadier-general 
of the Twelfth Brigade which was disbanded 
in 1874. This was one of the best-drilled and 
best-disciplined brigades in the state, outside 
of the large cities. In 1845 Judge Gibson be- 
came an Odd Fellow, passed the various 
chairs in Salem Lodge, No. 45, served as dis- 
trict deputy grand master for the years 1856- 
57, and was grand warden of the Grand 
Lodge of Northern New York in 1857 ; dep- 
uty grand master in 1858 and grand master 
in 1859. In i860 he was elected worshipful 
master of Salem Lodge, No. 391, Free and Ac- 
cepted Masons. In 1862 was appointed sen- 
ior grand deacon of the Grand Lodge of New 
Y'oris. In 1863 he was elected junior grand 
wajrden ; in 1865 elected senior grand 
warden, an office he held three years: in 1868 
he was elected grand master and re-elected in 
1869. As grand master of the state of New 
York he, June 8, 1870, assisted by the officers 
of the Grand Lodge and twelve others of the 
craft, laid the cornerstone of the Masonic 
Temple in the city of New York. During his 
entire connection with the Grand Lodge he 
occupied a commanding position and served as 
chairman or member of many important com- 
mittees. The honor of being grand master 
of both these leading fraternities is one in 
which he stands alone in the state, no other 
man having been grand master of both or- 
ders. During the civil war he was a strong 
union man and spoke and worked for the 
cause. He was a member of the war commit- 
tee of Salem, that did its duty so well that 
the town had its quota raised in advance of 
every draft except the first. 

The old Court House in Salem wa^ erected 
in the year 1800, and had outlasted its useful- 
ness. The judges, lawyers and laymen com- 
plained of it, but there was strong opposition 
from other towns, who wished to get the coun- 
ty seat away from Salem. In 1868 Judge Gib- 
son was elected supervisor for the purpose of 
carrying out the desires of those who wanted 
the new court hou.se in Salem. In December 



of that year he brought the matter before the- 
board of supervisors who appointed a com- 
mittee with Mr. Gibson to obtain plans. In 
January following it was resolved to build in' 
Salem and he was made chairman of the- 
building committee. Thirty thousand dollars- 
was appropriated for the building, and it is 
worthy of mention that the committee kept 
the cost within the appropriation. Judge Gib- 
son was always identified with the cause of 
education, serving from June 17, 1845, until' 
his death, June 6, 1897, as a member of the 
board of trustees of Washington Academy. 
In every way he was closely conected with 
the development of his village. He drew the 
charter which went into effect in 185 1 which 
provided for a new school system and drew 
the agreement between the board of trustees 
and the academy and the board of education, 
of the village, wliereby the common schools- 
were consolidated and sheltered within the 
walls of the academy. This led to the adop- 
tion of the Union or graded system of educa- 
tion, that has proved so beneficial to Salem' 
youth. He was elected a member of the hoard 
of education soon after its organization and 
held until his death. In i860 he assisted in 
organizing St. Paul's Episcopal Church at 
Salem, was chosen one of the wardens, and 
soon afterward was licensed a lay reader by- 
Bishop Potter of the New York diocese in 
i860. 

He was deeply interested in the local his- 
tory of Washington county, and at the for- 
mation of the county Historical Society, in 
1876, was elected president. On the occasion 
of his election he delivered an address on the 
history of agriculture in the county. At the 
laying of the cornerstone of the new court 
house at Sandy Hill (Hudson Falls), June 8, 
1872, he delivered an historical address on the 
bench and bar of the county for one hundred 
years. He also published sketches on the 
graves and gravestones of the county, pn jour- 
nalism and various other subjects. 

He was a member of the American Geo- 
graphical Society and took deep interest in its 
work. Although not looked upon as a busi- 
ness but as a professional man, he was for 
many years a director and vice-president of 
the National Bank of Salem and was officially 
connected with the management of Evergreen 
cemetery. It is worthy of mention that four 
generations have been connected with the 
l^ress of Washington county. James B. Gib- 
son owned the Rei^istcr and conducted it sev- 
eral years. James Gibson owned and edited 
the Post. James (2), son of Judge James 
(i) Gibson, edited the SaJcm Press for three 
years. James (3), son of James (2) Gibson,

was manasjer of Salem Rcziezi'-Prcss for five 
years. 

JiKli;e Gibson married. October 17, 1841, 
Jane, tlaughter of Ira and Wealthy Ann (Gil- 
bert) Woodworth. Children: Mary, mar- 
ried T. A. Wright, died August 22. 1902. 
James, a lawyer of Salem, died October 9. 
i88i. Jennie, married Charles W. Tovvnscnd. 

This personal appearance of Judge Gibson 
is thus described in '"Life Sketches of the 
Legislature" published in 1867: "Senator 
Gibson is a gentleman of quiet dignity. His 
long flowing hair and whiskers tinged with 
gray, his mild eye which seems to be over- 
flowing with kindly feelings ;. his low, persua- 
sive voice, which is seldom brought up to a 
liigh pitch, unite in throwing around him a 
personal atmosphere which renders his pres- 
ence both pleasant and powerful." 



The name Mansfield, "A 
MAXSFIFJ.D man in the field," is be- 
lieved to be of Saxon 
origin. In Germany the name is Mansf eld ; 
in England, after the Saxons mixed with Nor- 
mans. Danes. Celts and others, it easily be- 
came "Mansfield." The noble family of Mans- 
f eld of Germany is very ancient ; traces nearly 
to the time of Charlemagne, and flourished 
down to the present time. Exeter. England, 
the place from which the original Mansfield 
departed for America, has been a city since 
the year 1200. There was a Sir John Mans- 
field mayor of the city a few years prior to 
the emigration. He was also "Master of the 
Manories and Queens Surveyor under Queen 
Elizabeth." The American ancestor and 
founder of the family in Connecticut, most of 
them in Xew York state and in the west and 
south, was Richard Mansfield, of Exeter, 
Devonshire, England, and New Haven, Con- 
necticut. 

(I) Richard Mansfield witli his wife Gillian 
(maiden name unknown), settled in Quinni- 
piack (Xew Haven), Connecticut, in 1639. A 
deed for land, now the northwest corner of 
Church and Elm streets, proves this date. In 
a list of first planters, 1641, he is jnit down at 
£400. thirty acres in the first division, six 
acres in the "Neck," twenty-two acres of 
meadow, and eighty-eight acres in the second 
■division. He owned other lands probably by 
purchase and established his home on his large 
farm in the second division called the "East 
farms," some four and one-half miles out on 
the present North Haven road, which was his 
Tiome until his death. January 10, 1665. He 
took the oath of fidelity, July i, 1644. before 
Governor Eaton and the general court at New 
Havi.li. Gillian, his wife, survived him and 



married, in 1667, Alexander Field. After the 
death of her second husband she lived with 
her son Moses in New Haven. She died 
1699. Children: Joseph, see forward, and 
Moses, born in 1639: married (first) Mercy 
Glover, (second) Abigail Yale. He was ma- 
jor of militia and in honor of a victory he and 
his command gained over the Indians, the 
town of Mansfield was named after him. He 
was a member of the general court forty-eight 
sessions (two sessions annually); judge of 
the probate and of the county court. 

( n ) Jdscph, eldest son of Richard and Gil- 
li;in Mansfield, is believed to have been born 
in England in 1636. He took the freeman's 
oath. February 8, 1657, or as soon as he was 
of age. He died November 15, 1692. He in- 
herited his father's large farm and had a 
town lot and house in New Haven, as well as 
a large amount of land in other parcels, in- 
cluding the grounds now owned and occu- 
pied by Yale University buildings. His es- 
tate inventoried four hundred pounds. His 
seat in the "meeting house" was No. 8 in the 
"long seats for men." He married, about 
1657, Mary . Children: i. Mary, un- 
married. 2. Martha, married, December 16.

moved to Kent, Connecticut, where he was in 
business with his father-in-law, Bradley Mills. 
as Mills & Mansfield. He joined with his 
son-in-law, Hugh White, in building a flour- 
ing mill, later occupied by the Munson Manu-

He prepared for college in the schools of 
Sharon, Connecticut. Chittenango, Madison 
county, New York, and at Montgomery, Or- 
ange county. New York. He entered the ju- 
nior class at Union College in 1833. and was 
graduated 1835. He embarked in business life 
with his brother-in-law, Hon. Hugh White, 
in the manufacture of hydraulic cement, con- 
tinuing for fifteen years with successful re- 
sults. He had developed an unusual literary 
talent and on going out of business gave him- 
self up wholly to authorship. He wrote and 
published "The Morning Watch," a narrative 
poem, published by G. P. Putnam, 1850; "Up 
Country Letters," Appleton. 1852 : "Country 
Alargins," a joint work with S. H. Hammond, 
published by J. C. Derby, 1855. In 1855 he 
engaged again in business in Cohoes, New 
York, where he had a knitting mill, and con- 
tinued ten years During the war, and strictly 
in reference to the army in the field, he began 
a daily hour prayer meeting in his mill at the 
noon hour, and on Sunday afternoons had a 
union prayer meeting for the same purpose 
at his home on the north side of the river. 
11iis prayer meeting continued at the mill 
without any interruption for about five hun- 
dred days, up to the close of the war, the last 
meeting being held .\]iril 5, when the news 
came of the taking of Richmond. His health

retiu-ned to literary pursuits. His first work 
was "The Outlines of the Mental Plan," fol- 
lowed bv the "Precepts and Doctrines of 
Christ," published by Phillips & Hunt, 1883, 
and by E. & T. B. Young, 1884. He is the 
author of the tracts "My Token," "The Spir- 
itual Body," and books "Hymns and Poems,"' 
"Looking up the Plan." "Overwork" and 
"Coming into Form." He was a man of ver- 
satile talent, and great ability, whose influence 
ff>r good cannot be estimated.

about the time of his first marriage becairie 
a member of the Protestant Episcopal church. 
He continued his Hterary and religious work 
up to the year of his death, 1899. He mar- 
ried (first ) Carrie AI., daughter of Rev. Lewis 
Bayard, LL. D. ; married (second) December 
19," 1855, Sarah B., born in York, New York, 
1837, died in \\'aterford, March 10, i860, 
daughter of Samuel and Hannah Lewis, of

ried (third) June 4, 1862, Mary J. Hogan. 
Children: i. William K., see forward. 2. 
Joseph Punderson. born November 30, 1858, 
died September 23, 1859, both children of his 
second marriage. 

(Vni) William K., eldest son of Lewis 
William and Sarah B. (Lewis) Mansfield, 
was born in Waterford. New York, in the old 
Mansfield home on Saratoga avenue, Septem- 
ber 17, 1856. He obtained his primary and 
preparatory education at St. John's Episco- 
pal School and the public schools of Cohoes. 
He entered Amherst College where he com- 
pleted his freshman and sophomore years. He 
left college and entered the knitting mill with 
his father, remaining one year. He then took 
the management of a flouring mill owned by 
Mr. Alansfield, senior, at Crescent, near Wa- 
terford. It was his father's wish that he fin- 
ish his college course and he hoped to discour- 
age him with business life, so the positions 
given the young man were not sinecures, 
but he was determined to succeed in busi- 
ness and stuck to his work so faithfully 
that the mill property was deeded to him. 
He remained at the mill seven years, made 
many improvements and did a prosperous 
business, disposing of the plant finally at 
a very advantageous figure. . In 1884 he 
embarked in journalism by purchasing the 
Cohoes Daily A'ezi.'s. of which he was 
editor and owner for fourteen years. He 
made the paper a paying property and an in- 
fluential factor in the politics of the city. He 
retained control of the editorial page and sup- 
ported only men and measures that in his 
judgment made for good government, na- 
tional, state and local. In 1898 he disposed 
of his newspaper plant and engaged in brick 
manufacturing at Crescent, where his yards 
and kilns are located. This enterprise he still 
continues. He retains his home at the home- 
stead on Saratoga avenue in Waterford, but 
designated Cohoes "North Side." His brick- 
making plant is a large and modern one, the 
output being between three and four millions 
of merchantable brick annually, that find a 
ready market. Mr. Mansfield has always been 
an active Republican and has spent much of 
his time in the public service. In 1878 he was 



appointed justice of the peace to fill a vacancy 
in the town of Half Moon, Saratoga county, 
and was twice elected to the same office, while 
living in Crescent. On his return to Water- 
ford, Albany county, he was elected to the 
same office, there continuing through four 
terms of four years each, representing the 
"North Side." In 1896 he was appointed gen- 
eral committee clerk at Albany by the assem- 
bly and was assigned to duty at the desk of 
the journal clerk during sessions. The fol- 
lowing year he was appointed deputy journal 
clerk, continuing as such by successive ap- 
pointments until 1901. At the session of 
1901-02 he represented his district in the 
assembly, serving on the insurance, excise 
and labor committees. In 1903 he was again 
appointed assistant journal clerk and in 1905 
general clerk of the assembly, and has been 
successively appointed as such up to the pres- 
ent time (1910). He is secretary of the coun- 
ty Republican conmiittee, and a man of in- 
fluence, experience and ability. He is a mem- 
ber of St. John's Episcopal Church, Cohoes, 
and affiliated with the Masonic fraternity. 

He married, October 30, 1882. Etta C. 
Clute, born in Crescent. Saratoga county. New 
York, daughter of Charles F. and Delia 
(Teachout) Clute, the latter born in Half 
Moon, died 1900. Charles F. Clute was born 
in Half Moon. 1834. died 1903. He was a 
farmer : also interested with his son-in-law, 
Mr. ATansfield, in the brick business, and' 
nearly his whole life owned and conducted a 
general store at Crescent. He was a Demo- 
crat and served as supervisor of the town of 
Half Moon several terms. 



The family tradition of the No- 
NOBLF ble family herein traced is that 

they descend from Scotch an- 
cestry, although the Massachusetts and Con- 
necticut families are given as of English 
birth. The name is found in both countries 
and the early settlers were no doubt of both 
nationalities. The first record in this line- 
was Moses Noble, horn in Portsmouth. New 
Hampshire. While the connection cannot be 
proved from the records puljlished. yet there 
is strong proof that he was a descendant of 
Thomas Noble, born in England in or about 
1632, died in Westfield, Massachusetts, Janu- 
ary 20, 1704. He is mentioned in Boston his- 
tories as early as 1653. when he was admit- 
ted an inhabitant January 5 of that year. 
That same year he removed' to Springfield. 
Massachusetts, where he opened an account 
at the store of John Pyncheon. He later re- 
moved to Westfield. Massachusetts, where 
lands were granted him Tulv. iC^CiG, but he

\\Mnchester, though not seriously. He was 
engaged at the battles of Plain Store, siege 
of Port Hudson, Baton Rouge, Opqyihanic 
Creek, and other minor engagements during 
his first enlistment, and was in the battles of 
Winchester, Fisher's Hill and Cedar Creek 
under General Sheridan. Being so much un- 
der age, the records of the war department 
show him to have been two years older than 
he really was at date of enlistment. Fie was 
a good soldier and shirked no duty. After 
returning to civil life he engaged with his 
father at carpentry in Lawrence, Massachu- 
setts, remaining with him two years. He then 
took tip the business of a millwright, working 
in various positions. For twenty years he 
was employed in the mechanical department 
of the Russell Paper Company of Lawrence, 
Massachusetts, and was master mechanic of 
the Tillotson & Hollingsworth Paper Com- 
jiany at Groton, Massachusetts, then occupied 
the same position with the Hudson River Pulp 
& Paper Company at Palmer's Falls, New 
York, later returning to Lawrence, Massa- 
chusetts, with the I'jiierson Manufacturing

He was a Democrat in politics, ami a member 
of the Dutch Reformed church. Since his 
death Mrs. Schuyler has continued her resi- 
dence in Ravena, where she is held in univer- 
sal esteem. She is an active member of

The Greene family of Amster- 
GREEXE dam, New York, are descen- 
dants of Thomas Greene, of 
England, the final e of the name being dropped 
by the second generation in America. There 
were other families of the same name who set- 
tled in Xew England at an early date, and 
there were others by the name of Thomas. 
There was a Thomas who was on record in 
Roxbury in 1648; Thomas, who came in the 
■"Speedwell" in 1636; and Thomas, of Middle- 
sex. These must not be confounded with the 
Thomas Greene, of Maiden, w^ho founded the 
family under consideration in this sketch. 

( I ) Thomas Greene, the immigrant, was 
lx)rn in England, probably in Leicestershire, 
about 1606, died in New England, December 
19, 1667. The first record extant of him is 
dated 1653, when his youngest daughter, Dor- 
cas, was born, but it is exceedingly probable 
that he was an early settler in the Massachu- 
setts Colony ; that he remained temporarily 
in one of the new settlements until about 
1649-50, when he removed to the northern 
part of Maiden, now Melrose, w-here he se- 
cured his farm of sixty-three acres ; that all 
his children lived with him or near him with 
the exception of daughter Hannah, who mar- 
ried and lived in Woburn. It is certain that 
he lived in Maiden, Massachusetts, as early as 
October 28, 1651, when his wife Elizabeth 
and daughter of the same name, signed a peti- 
tion to the general court concerning the Rev. 
Marmaduke Aiatthews. A portion of his farm 
in Maiden was still in the possession of some 
of his descendants two hundred years later. 
He was selectman of Maiden in 1658, served 
several times on the Middlesex county grand 
jury and was known as Thomas Greene, Sr.. 
to distinguish him from his son, Thomas, Jr., 
and another Thomas Greene of the town, who 
had no suffix. His ten children w-ho had been 
living near him commenced to separate about 
1676. Four of his sons — Samuel, \\'illiam, 
Nathaniel and Jabez — removed to Leicester, 
and their descendants are found to-day in 
evcrv state in the Union. .\nother son. 



Henry, removed to Killingly, Connecticut, as 
did the children of his son Jacob. Another 
son, David, removed to Amherst, Xew Hamp- 
shire ; two others, Jacob and Benjamin, to 
Hanover, New Jersey. Thomas Greene, Sr., 
in his will, dated Xovember 12, 1667, does not 
mention any wife, but makes bequests to his 
"eldest son" Thomas, to sons John, William, 
Henry, Samuel and to daughters Elizabeth, 
Mary, Hannah, Martha and Dorcas. This 
shows that all his children were living at the 
date of his death. Some of them were born 
in England, but it is not on record how many. 

He married (first) Elizabeth , who 

died August 22, 1658, and is believed to have 
been the mother of all his children. He mar- 
ried (second) Frances, born in 1608, widow 
of Richard Cook, previously widow of Isaac 
Wheeler, who had had children by her first 
two husbands. 

(II) Thomas (2) Green, son of Thomas 
( I 1 and Elizabeth Greene, was born in Eng- 
land about 1630, died in ]\Ialden, Massachu- 
setts, February 13, 1671-72, having made his 
will the previous day. He was a farmer and 
always lived in Maiden, where he was admit- 
ted freeman. May 31, 1670. He married, 
about 1653, Rebecca, daughter of Joseph Hills. 
She was one of the thirty-six women who 
signed the petition to the general court, pray- 
ing that body to excuse some errors and fail- 
ings of Rev. Marmaduke ^latthews. first min- 
ister to Maiden, who had fallen under the cen- 
sure of that honorable body. Children: i. 
Rebecca, married Thomas Newxll. 2. 
Thomas, not mentioned in his father's will, be- 
ing probably then deceased. 3. Hannah, died 
in infancy. 4. Hannah, married John Vinton, 
of \\'oburn. and had a numerous posterity, 
which is fully recorded in the "Vinton Memo- 
rial." 5. Samuel, see forward. 

(HI) Captain Samuel Green, youngest 
child of Thomas (2) and Rebecca (Hills) 
Green, was born in Maiden, Massachusetts, 
October 5. 1670, died January 2, 1735-36. He 
resided in Maiden until 1717, when he re- 
moved to Leicester, being one of the original 
founders of that town. Leicester was granted 
by the general court, February 10, 1713-14, 
and Captain Green was appointed one of the 
committee by the proprietors to settle it. He 
had one hundred and eighty acres of land 
granted him in five parcels, and was a very in- 
fluential man in all the affairs of the new set- 
tlement, the part of the town once occupied 
by him being still Greenville in his honor. It 
is a village in the southern ])art of Leicester, 
about one mile north of the South Leicester 
railroad depot. His title of captain was be- 
stowed upon him for service in the militia.

(I\') Rev. Thomas (3) (ireen, only son 
of Captain Samuel and Elizabeth (Upham) 
Green, was born in Maiden, Massachusetts, 
1699, died in Leicester, August 19, 1773. He 
acquired a knowledge of medicine and surgery 
from two surgeons of the English buccaneers, 
who boarded with his father for many years, 
they having come in and surrendered them- 
selves under an oflfer of pardon from the Eng- 
lish government. They instructed Thomas in 
what they knew of medicine, gave him a few 
medical books, and with this equipment and 
an uncommon amount of practical wisdom, 
he was enabled to enter upon and pursue the 
practice of medicine with great success. This 
practice extended into various parts of the col- 
ony, and into Rhode Island and Connecticut. 
He was not, however, more eminent as a phy- 
sician than he was as a minister of the Gospel. 
Having embraced the Piajitist faith, he organ- 
ized a church and society of that denomination 
in South Leicester, and was ordained their 
pastor in 1736. He supplied their pulpit for 
many years, and his church grew and flour- 
ished. He donated a farm for a parsonage, 
a lot of land for the meeting house, and for 
a burial ground, in which he and his wife were 
buried, but their remains, together whh those 
of his father, were afterward removed by their

cnlli child of Samuel (3) and Hannah (Kin- 
ntv ) Greene was born in Leicester. January 
<;, 1790, died in Amsterdam, New York, Octo- 
ber 13, 1864. He settled in Amsterdam, in 
1840, becoming a pioneer carpet manufac- 
turer there, and being associated there -for a 
time with John Sanford. of the Sanford Car- 
jiet Mills. He was later in the manufactur- 
ing; business alone, and was a highly respected 
and energetic man of affairs in the city. He 
married, December 10. 1812, Betsey, daughter 
of Deacon Jedediah Kimball, of Woodstock, 
Connecticut. Children: i. Almeria. married

( \IH ) William Kimball, eldest son and sec- 
ond child of William Kinney and Betsey 
(Kimball) Greene, was born July 18. 1816, 
died in Rome, Italy, while on a European tour, 
January, 1870. He was one of the potent 
factors in securing for the city of Amsterdam 
the water supply and power which gave it its 
full impetus as a great manufacturing center, 
and was the founder of two of its most im- 
portant industries. He was a member of the 
firm of Wait, Greene & Company, manufactur- 
ers of satinet, at Hagamans Alills in 1840, but 
in 1842 withdrew from that firm and located 
in .Amsterdam, where he started a carpet fac- 
tory in a small building, afterward the site of 
the Greene Knitting Company's works. This 
was the forerunner and foundation of the car- 
pet industry in Amsterdam and of the present 
immense business of S. Sanford & Sons. Mr. 
Greene ran his business alone for a few years, 
then John Sanford acquired an interest, and 
the plant was removed to the old Harris mill, 
further up the stream. Prior to 1856 Mr. 
Greene retired from the firm, which after other 
changes became, in 1853, the sole property of 
Stephen Sanford, who later admitted his sons. 
In 1856 William K. Greene and John Mc- 
Dcnnell began the manufacture of knit goods 
in the small building where later stood the 
extensive plant of the Greene Knitting Com- 
pany. In 1868 Air. AFcDonnell withdrew, the 
business henceforth being conducted by Mr. 
Greene, who increased it by the erection of a 
much larger mill on the same site, operating 
with thirteen sets of machinery. In 1870 he 
died and was succeeded by his sons, Elijah P. 
and Henry E. Greene, with John K. War- 
nick, under the firm name of W. K. Greene's 
Sons & Company. Ujjon the death of E. P. 
Greene, the firm became W. K. Cireene's Son 
& Company. In 1881 Henry E. Greene died, 
and in 1S82 the Greene Knitting Company. 



manufacturers of knit underwear, was formed. 
If any one man can be called the father of 
manufacturing interests in Amsterdam, it is 
William K. Greene, these two great industries, 
car];el> and knit goods, both being founded by 
liini. 

Amsterdam originally had sufficient water 
])()wer from Chuctenunda creek to run its 
mills, but with the denuding of the northern 
hills and mountains, the supply was decreased. 
Dams were resorted to, but in 1855 it was 
necessary to again increase the supply of 
water. In that year a reservoir was con- 
structed in Galway, covering four hundred 
and fifty acres, which was enlarged in 1865 to 
five hundred and fifty acres. In 1875 the 
banks of the reservoir were raised, increasing 
the area of stored water to one thousand acres. 
Through all these operations Mr. (jreene bore 
a conspicuous part. He was one of the in- 
corporators of the water supply company and, 
when the first board of trustees was formed, 
for the purpose of maintaining the supply, he 
was chosen one of the Water Supply Com- 
pany. This permanent settlement of the ques- 
tion of power has been of immense advantage 
to .Amsterdam, as it attracted many new in- 
dustries, and has resulted in making the city 
one of the most noted manufacturing centers 
in Central New York. In this, as in the start- 
ing of pioneer industries, great credit must be 
awarded William Kimball Greene. He was a 
man of great energy and initiative and a born 
leader of men. He was interested in all forms 
of charity and benevolence for the benefit of 
those less fortunately situated than himself, 
and he and his wife gave generous aid to the 
institutions of the city. The record he left is 
a noble one, and his memory is still warmly 
cherished. Mr. Greene married, December 22, 
1838. Jane M. Priest. Children: i. Elijah 
Priest, see forward. 2. Henry Eckford, see 
forward. 

(IX) Elijah Priest, eldest son of William 
Kimball and Jane M. (Priest) Greene was 
born May 22, 1843, died December 9. 1876. 
To a great degree he inherited the mechani- 
cal ability of his father. He was an exten- 
sive traveler, a great lover of beauty in art 
and nature, his collection of geological speci- 
mens .showing him to have been a geologist 
of no mean merit. On SejHember 28, 1865, 
he married at Ilion, New York, Ella, born 
June, 1845, daughter of Pliilo Remington, 
well known to the world as the inventor and 
manufacturer of the Remington typewriters 
and rifles. Children: 1. l-" red Remington, see

where he died June i, 1900. His father was 
James Kimmeburgh, his grandfather Edward 
"Delbridge, of Virginia, tlie latter being a sol-

(HI) Joseph, son of Robert and Sarah 
(Mark) Haswell, was born October 17, 1796, 
died October 22, 1856. He settled on the 
road from Hoosick to Hoosick Falls, on a 
farm consisting of about three hundred and 
fifty acres adjacent to his father's land. The 
home was beautifully located on a high eleva- 
tion known in those days as "The Haswell 
II ill." It gave a view of the surrounding 
country which was most picturesque, looking 
down on the Hoosick \'alley. He was a man 
of sterling equalities, independent in his views, 
a strong advocate for the cause of temperance 
which was not popular in those days. He 
was a member of the Presbyterian church at 
Hoosick Falls. He was one of the first 
breeders of Spanish Merino sheep in this

director of the old stage road which ran from 
Albany to ^lontreal called "The Montreal 
-Adams road." It was the great thoroughfare 
from Xew York to Canada, and for many 
years a large portion was under his super- 
vision. He was a man that commanded re- 
spect, a gentleman of the old school and one 
that lield an enviable position in the ommu- 
nity where he resided. He married (first) 
.Adelaide Leet : married (second) Eliza 
Haynes; married (third) at Hoosick, New

Hoosick: he was educated in the public 
schools : he inherited many of his father's 
characteristics and propensities, and one con- 
spicuous one was his love and rare judgment 
of blooded stock, and on his farm at Hoosick 
on the P)ennington road he kept blooded stock 
of all kinds ; he was a member of the Presby- 
terian church at Hoosick Falls, and a man 
of high character and firmness of purpose and 
wonderful energy and courage. In his early

to the Second Street Presbyterian Church, 
where she labored faithfully for many years ; 
she was then called to serve as city mission- 
ary where there were no limitations to her 
work : for twenty-one years she has been an 
ardent worker for fresh air children : for 
many years she was president of this organ- 
ized enterprise in Troy : scarcely a poor child 
in Troy but does not know and love her: for

rescue mission and held weekly prayer meet- 
ings at her home known as "Miss Haswell's 
Tuesday Night jMeeting" ; one important and 
special feature of this meeting was the privi- 
lege of sending requests for prayer which 
sometimes came through the mails ; she is 
well known in this city as an earnest, strong 
Christian character; she has her own idea of 
duty, and like some of her antecedents is not 
controlled merely by public opinion ; she has 
a heart full of sympathy and love for those 
fighting the hard battles of life, and the poor, 
suffering and down-trodden know they will 
find a friend in her; she is a woman of un- 
wavering faith in God, and is not daunted by 
severe testings; she believes "the things that 
are impossible with man are possible with 
God," and this thought inspires in her great 
courage, perseverance and hope to face great 
difficulties ; one of her favorite mottoes is 
"Attempt great things for God, and expect 
great things from God." 4. Susan, died in

185 1 ; married, in 1870, John Dickinson War- 
ren, son of Dr. Warren, who was a practicing

ren is a Presbyterian minister in Elmira, New 
York, and has labored in this capacity for 
many years with success here and elsewhere, 
and with the aid in his church work of his 
modest, charming, yet efficient wife, who has 
this work at heart, their united labors have 
been richly rewarded in many ways ; child, 
Joseph Haswell, died in infancy. 6. Sarah, 
died in infancy. 



Thomas and John Wiswall, 
WTSWALL both prominent among the 

early settlers of Dorchester, 
Massachusetts, came from England, 1635, 
leaving behind them brothers .A^dam, Abiel and 
Jonathan. This record deals with the de- 
scendants of Thomas Wiswall. Both were el- 
ders of the church, both selectmen and sub- 
scribers to the school fund. Thomas, the 
younger brother, was a subscriber in 1641 ; 
selectman from 1644 to 1652. He died De- 
cember 6, 1683. No monument marks his 
grave, but that over the grave of Elder John 
states he was born in 1601, died in 1687, aged 
eighty-six years, which gives the a])proximate 
birth of Elder Thomas Wiswall. His farm of 
four hundred acres was in the limits of Dor- 
chester, and included a pond that bore his 
name. His house stood upon the southerly 
bank of the pond, and is described in his will

setts, May, 1686. 

(H) Captain Noah Wiswall, son of Elder 
Thomas and Elizabeth Wiswall, was baptized 
in Dorchester, Massachusetts, 1638. He was 
killed in battle with the Indians at Wheel- 
wrights Pond, July 6, 1690. He was a man 
of education and was employed. 1681, to 
transcribe the town records, was selectman in 
1685, assessor in 1686, and served on impor- 
tant committees. He was captain of the mili- 
tary company. When in 1690 a band of 
French and Indians were committing depreda- 
tions Captain Wiswall was slain in a battle 
with them. Tradition says he had a son John 
who fell in the same battle. Lands were 
granted the heirs of Captain Noah Wiswall 
in 1683 for his patriotic service. He married,

1803 



meetings were held in his house, and he gave 
the land on which their first meeting house 
was erected. S. F. Smith's life of Rev. Air. 
Grafton states that Captain Noah Wiswall 
was in the battle of Lexington. Three of his 
sons and some of his sons-in-law were in the 
East Newton company, commanded by his 
son, Captain Jeremiah Wiswall. .After the 
company had marched for Lexington he start- 
ed on foot and alone to follow them, saying, 
"I wish to see what the boys are doing." It 
seems almost impossible that he could have 
endured the march and the fatigues of the 
day, as he was then seventy-six years of age, 
but the roll of the East Newton company in 
the battle of Lexington, now in the office of 
the secretary of state of Alassachusetts, and 
sworn to by the captain of that company be- 
fore Judge Fuller, shows that he was in the 
company, and also several other aged men 
were volunteers in the ranks of the company 
on that day. He married (first) in 1720, 
Thankful, daughter of Jeremiah Fuller. She 
died in 1745. Married (second) in 1752, De-

terprises. Seth, after disposing of his farm 
( now a part of the corporate limits of West • 
Troy) settled in Albany where he died. He

ing until 1880, when he was elected vice-presi- 
dent. As a financier he was connected with 
the banking interests of Albany for over half 
a century, and his rare ability is indicated by 
the high standing of the institutions with

William .Arthur, A. 
\'AX ALSTYNE M., in his dictionary 

of Family and Chris- 
tian names says: "Van Alstyne" Local, from 
the old or high stone Dutch. Records in 
Holland show the family to be of ancient ori- 
gin being traced under different names back 
to the crowning of "Otho" in the year A. D. 
936. The family first appears under the 
name, Ralsko, which it abandoned in order 
to take that of Warternberg, wdiich they bore 
for several centuries. Jean Ralsko who died 
in Flanders in 1236, had built there the Cha- 
teau de Waldstein, the name of which he 
took to distinguish himself from his brother 
who bore that of Warternberg. The family 
has been traced under the name of Balstein 
in Spain, \'allenstein in France, Halsteyn in 
Flanders and \'an .Alstein in Holland. I*"rom 
Waldstein the name changed to Wallenstein, 
W^nlstein, Valstein, and finally became Van 
.Alstein, which with slight variations in spell- 
ing has ever since been used.- On early rec- 
ords in America, it appears as Van -Aelsteyn, 
\an Aalstvnc. \'an Alstyn. \'an .Mstein. A'an 
Alstvne and \'an Alstine. One branch 



dro];ped the \'an and are 1 n<nvn as Al-tvn. 
In the present day three forms of spelling are 
found: Van Alstine, \'an Alstyne and Alstyn. 

(I) The direct ancestor of the family in 
America was Jan Martense, signifying John, 
son of Marten Van Alstyne, the final se mean- 
ing son of. Jan Martense was of record in 
New Amsterdam (New York) as early as 
1643. In the Dutch manuscripts there is a 
bill of sale to him, dated December 11. 1646. 
How long he remained in New .Amsterdam is 
not known but in 1657 he is recorded in Al- 
bany, New A^ork, as owning a lot lying "East 
of Broadway and North of Columbia Street." 
This he held as late as 1693 and in the mean- 
time became patentee of two tracts of land 
in the county of "LTster." At that period Al- 
bany county embraced about all of the state of 
New A^ork lying north and west of Dutchess 
and Ulster counties. He also purchased a 
large tract of land "behind Kinderhook" 
where he resided until his death about 1698. 
L: 1695 he conveyed his home farm to his 
son Abraham, the latter giving back a cove- 
nant to pay the other heirs certain sums of 
money as provided in the conveyance. His 
wife was Dirkje Harmense (Dirkje being the 
feminine form of Richard). Their sons were: 
I. Abraham, see forward. 2. Marten, born 
July 18, 1655 : married (first) Jannetje Bo- 
gart: (second) Cornelia Van Den Bergh. 
3. Isaac, born July, 1657, married (first) Mar- 
ritje \'osburgh : (second) Jannetje J. \^alken- 
burg. 4. Lambert, married Jannetje Mingael. 
.All had the middle name Janse, signifying 
they were sons of Jan (John). 

(II) Abraham Janse. son of Jan Martense 
and Dirkje Harmense A'an .Alstyne, born 
1650, owned and cultivated the homestead 
farm at Kinderhook, deeded him by his father. 
This land as well as the deeds of conveyance 
has ever since been in the possession of his 
descendants. The name of his fir.st wife is 
not recorded. He married (second) January 
17. 1694, Maritie A'an Deusen. Children: i.

The early Havilands of 
HAVILAND England 'were of French 
birth, the original name be- 
ing De Havery. The earliest records state 
that three brothers of that name emigrated 
from France to England. While crossing the 
Channel it was agreed that the first to see land 
should say, "Have I Land" and that became 
their English surname. The Havilands of 
Flushing, Long Island, descend from William 
Haviland, who came from England and set- 
tled first at Newport, Rhode Island. He was 
freeman there, May 17, 1653, and a commis- 
sioner to the general court at Portsmouth,

of the Croton river, called Quaker brook, 
runs through it, and in the beautiful val- 
ley Roger and his brother Daniel settled, 
the place being known as "Haviland Hollow." 
The old Quaker burying ground and church

Simon Huntington, the 

HUNTINGTON ancestor of the 'Hunting- 
ton family, was born in 
England. He married Margaret Baret. In 
1633 he, with his wife and son, emigrated to 
.America. He died on the voyage and was 
buried at sea. 

(II) Simon (2), son of Simon (i) and 
]\fargaret (Baret) Huntington, was born in 
England in 1629. He married Sarah, daugh- 
ter of Joseph Clark, of W'indsor, and later 
of Saybrook, Connecticut. 

(HI) Deacon Joseph Huntington, son of 
Simon (2) and Sarah (Clark) Huntington, 
was born at Norwich. September, i66r. died 
December 29, 1747. He was one of the found- 
ers of Windham, Connecticut. He married 
Rebecca .Adgate, born June, 1666. 

(I\' ) Nathaniel, son of Deacon Joseph and 
Rebecca (Adgate) Huntingto'', was born at 
Norwich, September i, 1691. He married 
Mehitable Thurston. Children: Enoch, of 
further mention; Samuel, one of the signers 
of the Declaration of Independence, president 
of the colonial congress, and afterward gov- 
ernor of Connecticut. 

(Y) Rev. Enoch Huntington, son of Na- 
thaniel and Mehitable (Thurston) Hunting- 
ton, was born December t^, 1739. He grad- 
uated from Yale in 1759; studied for the min- 
istry and was ordained and installed over the 
First Church of Middletown. January. 1762, 
and there spent his life. He was considered 



during his collegiate course a man of remark- 
able talents and his classical and general 
scholarship subsequently justified the decision. 
He won the Berkely premium of his class. In 
the pulpit he was very popular. He took a 
great interest in politics during the revolu- 
tionary period, and many of his sermons and 
addresses of that day were printed and have 
been preserved. He married, at Windham, 
Connecticut, July 17, 1764, Mary, born Oc- 
tober 14, 1744, daughter of Samuel Gray. 

(\T) Judge Samuel Gray Huntington, son 
of Rev. Enoch and Alary (Gray) Huntington, 
was born at Middletown. Connecticut, May 21, 
T782, died at Troy, New York, July 5, 1854. 
He graduated from Yale in 1800, taking the 
Berkely premium. .At a meeting of the Rensse- 
laer county bar, held the day after his death, 
ample testimony was given of his ability and 
great worth ; we quote from the resolutions 
passed at that time. "Resolved, That the bar 
of this city, by the death of the Honorable 
Samuel G. Huntington, have lost their oldest 
member, a lawyer and a scholar ; a man thor- 
oughly bred to his profession, and ever ready 
to impart to others that knowledge which his 
careful training, advanced age and varied ex- 
l)erience had given him. Resolved, That the 
extent and variety of his classical and legal 
learning, may well awaken the emulation of 
us, his survivors." 

In seconding the resolutions, Hon. D. L. 
Seymour spoke as follows: "We are again 
assembled to take appropriate notice of the 
death of one of our members. The oldest 
member of the Rensselaer bar has fallen. Al- 
though past three score years and ten, yet 
such had been the vigor and animation of his 
declining years, that his sudden demise af- 
fected us almost as if he had been struck 
down in the full strength of manhood. We 
feel deeply this sudden providence, and as 
brethren of the legal profession feel that the 
iiar of our County has sustained a loss, and 
that we individually mourn the loss of a 
friend." Samuel Gray Huntington was the 
son of the Reverend Enoch Huntington, and 
like most of the youths of his native State, 
received the rudiments of a thorough educa- 
tion in the excellent school, then and still lib- 
erally and carefully sustained by the able leg- 
isolation of that State. .After leaving the com- 
mon school he passed through the education 
preparatory to admission to a collegiate course, 
and was admitted to Yale College, where he 
graduated with the honors of that ancient Uni- 
versity, in 1800. Judge Huntington left col- 
lege with a thorough classical education and 
at once entered upon the study of law, in the

then a [iracticing lawyer of good standing in 
his native town. After the usual period of 
study he was admitted to the bar of Middle- 
sex County. It is profitable to dwell for a mo- 
ment upon this period of his life. He had 
selected the law for his profession, and in 
making that choice he doubtless felt that the 
legal profession yielded to no other in dignity 
or importance. That the first object of the 
young lawyer, whether he consulted his repu- 
tation or his fame, was to master not only the 
forms, precedents and superficial structure of 
the science, but its first principles, its very 
fountain opening up through the social and 
political condition of man and disclosing the 
necessary wnles regulating his rights of per- 
son and property. At that day, too, the great 
lights of the bar and bench of his native State 
beckoned him onward in a course of honor- 
able distinction in his profession. Such men 
as Reeve and Swift adorned the bench, while 
Pierpont Edwards, Goddard, Daggett, and 
Gould, shone at the bar. Entering upon the 
practice of his profession with such an excel- 
lent preparation and under such incentive his 
success was almost certain. He had already 
attained a reputable standing among the 
younger members of the bar of his native State 
when, about the year 1806, he removed to New 
York State, and settled in Waterford. Sara- 
toga County. Here he soon rose to eminence 
as a lawyer, and ranked among the ablest of 
the many distinguished men who have graced 
the bar of that County. He removed to Troy 
in 1825. For many years his professional 
business here was among the largest and most 
lucrative. His counsel was sought in the most 
important cases, particularly in those relating 
to real estate. In this branch of the law he 
was master, as well from his intimate ac- 
quaintance with the decisions of the English 
Courts as from the fact that the period of his 
j)ractice reaching to upward of half a cen- 
tury, embraced that space in the history of 
our country during which not only the system 
of our law of real estate, but in fact almost 
Ihe entire body of American common law, 
had been formed. When he commenced prac- 
tice there was no American Commentator on 
the law, and the reported cases, either in Con- 
necticut or New York, did not exceed half a 
dozen volumes. Under the administration of 
Governor Clinton, he was appointed to the 
office of judge of the Court of Common Pleas, 
Rensselaer County, and discharged its duties 
with great ability and impartiality. His de- 
cisions always commanded respect, as they 
were felt to be the result of an honest convic- 
tion of the right of the case in a mind guided 
by patient research and stored with legal lore. 



In the death of Judge Huntington, his breth- 
ren of the bar mourn the loss of one in whose 
counsels they have often confided, whose legal 
acquirements did honor to their profession, 
whose professional relation to them all was 
kind, courteous and honorable, and whose so- 
cial intercourse so often helped to strip labor 
of its drudgery, relieved life of its tedium, 
and to strew our pathway with pleasant, harm- 
less trifles and gay flowers." 

He married (first) ^lary Johnston, of Mid- 
dletown. He married (second) June 23, 1825, 
Janette C. Cheever, who died November 4, 
1856. Samuel G. Huntiygton had a daugh- 
ter, Sarah Sayr, born in Waterford. New 
York; married, November 30, 1841, John H. 
Whitlock, of Trov, New York. 



r)ne authority defines the name 

TERRY Terry thus:' "Not 'the tearful 

one," as some entomologists have 

it, but a corruption of Theodoric, the persona! 

name." 

Mr. Ferguson in his "Teutcmic Name Sys- 
tem," classes together the old German names 
Tarro, Terra, Torro, ninth century Terri, 
the English names Darr, Darrow, Door. 
Dorey, Dorre, Tarr, Tarry, Terry, Torrey, and 
the French names Dary, Dorre, Dor, Dore, 
Tarie, Terray, Terre, and he derives these 
from the old Norse word doerr, meaning 
spear, probably from the Sanscrit root tar. 
Mr. Samuel Terry, of New York City, has 
made investigation and thinks it originated 
among the early French, where under the form 
of Therry it was not an uncommon personal 
name, and through the Franks coming to be 
regarded as French, and is now sometimes 
found there as a family name in this form 
and as Therry, and also Terry. The earliest 
information of the founder of the family in 
this country is an agreement formed by Wil- 
liam Pyncheon and Samuel Terry, OctolDer 15, 
1650, whereby the latter is to receive a cer- 
tain amount for his services, and be taught the 
trade of linen spinner, he binding himself to 
be diligent in service. Signed by Samuel 
Terry, Benjamin B. Cooley (his mark), and 
William Pyncheon, witness Richard Maund 
and John Benham. Hon. William Pyncheon 
was in England in the spring of 1650 and 
there made the contract, and doubtless it was 
then that he took into apprenticeship the boy 
Samuel Terry, who may have been of Rarnet, 
a village eleven miles from London. He may 
have been an orphan whom Mr. Pyncheon had 
known, and it is unlikely that he would have 
taken such a boy for less than the entire time 
of his minority, accordingly he was probably 
liorn about the year 1633 or 34. Mr. Pyn-

cheon returned to England, and was relieved 
of the contract. 

Samuel Terry, born about 1633, in Eng- 
land, arrived in America about 1650, was of 
Springfield, iMassachusetts. in 1654, and was 
granted land, January 7, 1654, consisting of 
ten acres on "Chuckapee Plain" on condition 
that he remain in the town five years. In 1658 
he forfeited it by leaving. He was granted 
land at Wononaco town, 1664, and land at 
I'resh Water Brook (now Enfield) in 1665. 
lie was granted thirty acres of upland, along 
by his meadow land beyond Chicopee Plain 
in 1670. He with others was assessed two 
loads of firewood for the use of their pastor. 
In 1678 he was appointed a surveyor of high- 
ways. His name and that of his son Samuel 
a])pear in a list of persons, who took the oath 
of allegiance, December 31, 1678, and Janu- 
ary I, 1679. He married. January 3, 1660, 
Ann Lobdell, and the town settled with him 
for his claim to the land before mentioned by 
making him a grant a little further south. In 
May, 1684, his wife died, also his adopted 
child, Johny Matthews. In 1685 he was one 
of a town committee to establish boundaries 
between Springfield and adjoining towns, and 
the records speak of him as Sergeant Samuel 
Terry. In 1690 he married Sarah, widow of 
John Scott, and daughter of Thomas and Mar- 
garet Bliss. In 1693 he made an agreement 
to teach the art of weaving to his stepson, 
Ebenezer Scott, whence it appears he still 
practiced it himself. He was also chosen con- 
stable this same year. He and his wife parted 
in 1694, and she died September 27, 1705. In 
1730 the administration of his estate was 
granted to his sons, Samuel and Thomas, and 
in the record he is called "husbandman," "for- 
merly of Springfield." This was doubtless the 
year of his death. He signed his name in a 
free hand, as one much in the habit of writing, 
so probably he was better educated than most 
men of his time. His children were : Samuel, 
Ei^hraim. died young, Thomas, Mary, Rebec- 
ca, died young, Ephraim, Rebecca, Elizabeth 
and Ann. The line herein traced descends 
from this family through Enfield. Connecticut, 
but it has been impossible to get the connec- 
tion from public records. The absence of any 
vital statistics, in nearly all the state of New 
York, in early days renders it extremely diffi- 
cult to trace any line in this state withcnit the 
aid of private records.

( \'l ) William Paterson, second child of 
General Stephen and Cornelia (Paterson) 
\'an Rensselaer, was born in the Manor 
House at .Albany New York, March 6, 1805, 
died at New York, New York, November 13, 
1872. He received a thorough preparatory 
education and then entered Yale College, grad- 
uating in the class of 1824. On leaving col- 
lege he went to Edinburgh, Scotland, where 
he studied law through four years, completing 
his studies in Paris. He was a scholarly man, 
with intellectual tastes, eminent as a philan- 
thropist and, as was said of him, "was re- 
garded widely as an ideal Christian gentle- 
man." He built the handsome residence on 
tiie brow of the wooded hill on the east side 
of the Hudson opposite the northern end of 
Albany, around 1840, or about the time of his 
marriage. It was a mansion comparing favor- 
ably with that of his elder brother, Stephen 
\'an Rensselaer, who had inherited the Manor 
House in .-Xlbany. He laid out the extensive 
grounds with the idea of making the place 
one of the finest estates in the entire state. 
He furnished the interior with objects of art 
gathered abroad, and his library was a notable 
feature of his home. The winding staircase 
of selected Italian marble has been greatly ad- 
mired by critics of architecture. On the 
southern side, as a wing, he built a mammoth 
conservatory. The stables were at the further 
end of a lawn extending nearly half a mile 
eastward. The west entrance faced upon a 
plateau which dropped abruptly to the river, 
affording a charming vista of the Hudson 
and the city of Albany spread along its shore, 
while in the far distance were the Catskill 
mountains as a background for the picture. 
Owing to the serious "Anti-Rent Feuds" 
which disturbed the conduct of the \'an Rens- 
selaer landed estate, he left this home to take 
u]) his residence in New York City and at 
Manursing Island, Rye, New York. The 
above property was finally purchased by Paul 
Forbes, and for many years thereafter was 
popularly known as the "Forbes Manor," and 
for the twenty-five years previous to 1910 
was practically unoccupied excepting by care- 
takers.

most prominent publicists and respected states-

and coadjutor of Calhoun. Although Dr. 
Turnbull studied medicine and graduated as a 
physician, he was not a general practitioner, 
as he early inherited from his father the lat- 
ter's extensive estates in Issaguena county, 
Mississippi, comprising six thousand acres of 
productive cotton plantations. It was on these 
he passed his winters, personally superintend- 
ing the details of business management and 
caring for the welfare of his dependents,

most useful and highly appreciated. His 
summer residence and the family home was

(II) Hendrick Van Rensselaer, third child 
of Colonel Jeremias (the third Patroon) and 
Maria (Van Cortlandt) Van Rensselaer (q.v.) 
was born in Rensselaerswyck, October 23, 1667,

Kiliaen, was the fourth Patroon, and was 
known as the "Seconal Lord of the Manor," 
being the second patroon to reside in and 
manage affairs of the colony. Besides Kiliaen, 
he had no other brother, and only two sisters, 
consequently to him came an important share 
in the vast landed property of the Manor. A 
settlement was made in New York City, No- 
vember I. 1695, with all those living in Hol- 
land in any way concerned through blood re- 
lationship with the estate in this country, and 
following that .solution of the future status 
of the land, a division was made by Kiliaen, 
as the olilc-t cliild. Iiv wliich he conveved to

Hendrick. on June i, 1704, the Claverack 
patent and some one thousand five hundred 
acres en the east side of the Hudson river, in 
Columbia county, located opposite Albany. This 
was commonly called the "Lower Manor." The 
name Greenbush was derived from the Dutch, 
Greyne Bosch, a title applied to the woods 
covering this tract, by the first patroon when 
corresponding; with his managers residing in 
the colony. 

Hendrick \'an Rensselaer married, New 
York, New York, March 19, 1688, Catharina

(HI) Johannes, ninth child (and seconil 
son) of Hendrick and Catharina (\an Hrugh) 
Van Rensselaer, was born in the Crailo house 
at Greenbush, New York, February 11, 1708, 
died in 1783. Jeremias, his elder brother, died 
about ten years before the death of thei;- 
father, hence he inherited the Crailo, which 
was the name given to the house built close 
to the east bank of the Hudson river, and 
was constructed with the idea of being a place 
of defence in case of attack by the Indians, 
for in several places in the brickwork were 
stone pieces, pierced for the operation of a 
gun. It has been said that the bricks were 
brought from Holland in 1642, and the house 
then erected, by Van Rensselaer: but one 
should notice in this connection that Colonel 
Jeremias Van Rensselaer was born in .Amster- 
dam, Holland, only ten years previous to this 
date, and did not come to Rensselaerswyck 
(or .'\merica) until 1658, and the first of the 
name to come to this country was liis older 



l)ruther, Jan Baptist, who came in 1O51, or 
nearly ten years after the date attributed to 
the erection of this house, mostly by tradition. 
He was a member of the twenty-first provin- 
cial assembly ; was appointed captain of a 
company of foot in 1743, and promoted to be 
colonel. Although at the time of the revolu- 
tion he was too aged to participate in its con- 
flicts, he was a strong patriot, and three of his 
sons took active part, as commissioned officers. 
It was. here that General Abercrombie made 
his headquarters, with his troops encamped 
upon his property along the river shore, in 
June, 1758, on which date "Yankee Doodle" 
was composed by Surgeon Shackburg, while 
seated in Van Rensselaer's garden, before the 
army proceeded northward against ]\Iontcalm. 
All his children were born in this hmise and 
all were by his first wife. 

Johannes \'an Rensselaer married (first), 
January 3, 1734, Angelica Livingston. She 
was baptised July 17. 1698, daughter of Mayor

(IV) Jeremias, second child of Johannes 
and .Angelica (Livingston) Van Rensselaer, 
was born in the Crailo at Greenbush, New 
York, in 1738. died in 1769. As his death 
occurred about fourteen years before that of 
his father, he did not. of course, inherit the 
Crailo property as the oldest son ; but it was 
given instead, by will, to his only son as his

The name in England was for 
STE.\RNS centuries Sterne, coming from 

Germany with the Norman in- 
vaders under William the Conqueror. For a 
brief ])eiiod in .'\merica. the spelling remained 
the same, but changes soon crept in until we 
have not only the prevalent form Stearns, but 
Stearnes, Sternes, Sterns, Starnes and Starns, 
all simple variations of the old English name.

at Salem, Massachusetts, June 12, 1630. O.S. 
These is a tradition prevalent in Lynn, Mas- 
sachusetts, that three brothers, Daniel. Shu- 
bael and Isaac, came from England in 1630 
and settled near W'atertown. ]\Iassachusetts : 
that Daniel died unmarried ; that Shubael and 
Isaac brought their families with them ; that 
Shubael and wife died soon after landing, 
leaving two sons, Charles and Nathaniel, eight 
and ten years of age, who were reared and 
cared for by their uncle, Isaac ; that these 
•sons married, and each, as well as their uncle 
Isaac, left a large family, from whom are 
descended all of the name of Stearns with 
its variations of spelling, excepting that of 
.Stern, which is distinctly Jewish. 

The family crest is formed with a chevron 
and three crosses on a field of gold, together 
with various ornamental variations. 

(II Charles Sterne, born in England, date 
and place uncertain. He was admitted a free- 
man of ^\'atertown, May 6, 1646 (this shows 
him to have been of legal age and a church

in his will as "My kinsman, Charles 
Sternes." showing the first change in the

John ]\IcKie, the first of the name 
McKIE of whom we have record, was 

born about 1705, in the stewardry 
of Galloway, probably in Wigtonshire, Scot- 
land, and removed from there to Ayrshire 
about 1767, where he resided about seven 
years. His sons engaged in business in Ayr, 
but through the dishonesty of their partners 
failed, their failure involving their father so 
that he lost his entire ])roperty. This decided 
him to emigrate to America, which be ac-

John Reynolds ( i ) , jiro- 
REYXOLDS g;enitor o'f this branch of 
the family, is supposed to 
have sailed from the port of London — i. e., 
Ipswich, England, in 1633. Sarah Reynolds 
(his wife), aged 20, was a passenger on the 
ship "Elizabeth," which sailed from Ipswich 
"bound for New England the last of April, 
1634." 

Among the passengers were many who set- 
tled at Watertown, Massachusetts, and sub- 
sequently removed to Weathersfield and Stam- 
ford, Connecticut, but John Reynolds was not 
among them. John Reynolds was admitted a 
freeman of Watertown, May 6, 1635. Robert, 
his brother, had been admitted Septemlier 3, 
1634. 

Sir Richard Saltonstall, together with a 
body of Pilgrims or Separatists, had founded 
Watertown, Massachusetts, where a church 
was "gathered" under Phillips as pastor, Au- 
gust 27, 1630. The latter came from Box- 
ford, county Essex, and most of tlie colonists 
were members of his former charge. Un- 
fortunately, the records describing the settle- 
ment of Watertown are not in existence, but 
on page 4 of the earliest book of records is 
the first entry in which the names of colonists 
are mentioned: "Nov. 14, 1635 — agreed that 
Daniel Patrick, Brian Pemberton, Richard 
Bernard, Ephraim Child. .Abram Browne, 
Charles Chaddock and John Reynolds shall 
divide to every man his Property and Meddow 
and upland that is plowable and the rest to lie 
common." 

The first book of deeds entitled "The Wa- 
tertown Lands. Grants and Possessions" page 
157 and constituting the second inventory, de- 
scribes his allotment as follows : "John Rei- 
nolds. An Homestall of five acres and half 
by estimation bounded the North with the 
Highway, the South with Isaac Mixer and 
the East with John Sherman granted to him." 

Learning of the rich meadows along the 
Connecticut river, some few of the Water- 
town colonists, in the late autumn of 1634, 
founded the settlement of "Pyquag," now 
Wethersfield, and spent the winter there. On 
May 29th of the year following, six persons 
(among them Robert Reynolds) under the 
head of Rev. Richard Denton, who had re- 
ceived their dismissal from the Watertown 
church March 29th of that year, set out to 
"form a newe in a church covenant in the 
River of Connecticut" Conn. Col. Records, 
p. I). 

On October 15th, 1635, about sixty colon- 



ists set out from Watertown to the new set- 
tlement. Such was the general distress that 
many of them returned in December, but in 
the early spring of 1636 once more repaired 
to "Watertown on the Connecticut River." It 
was not until J'eb. 21, 1637, that the settle- 
ment received the name of Wethersfield. The 
colonists were continually exposed to danger 
from the Pequots. In April, 1637. they way- 
laid the settlers as they were going into their 
ing with those from Windsor and Hartford 
fields and killed six men and three women. 
On May 26, 1637, the Wethersfield men, unit- 
ing with those from Windsor and Hartford 
and with seventy Mohegans under their 
sachem, Uncas, attacked the Pequots, burnt 
seventy wigwams and killed five or six hun- 
dred of the enemy. (See Trumbull, vol. I, 
chap, v.) 

Both John and Robert were among those 
who reinoved from Watertown prior to July 
25, 1636, as they did not share in that divi- 
sion of land. As stated above, John still 
owned property in W'atertown at the time of 
the second inventory, i. e., 1644. Robert Feke, 
Brian Pemberton and Daniel Patrick are also 
included, although all of them had removed to 
Wethersfield and Stamford. 

Robert removed from Wethersfield to Bos- 
ton, where he died April 27, 1659. His will. 
executed 20, 2, 1658, proved in Boston, July 
27, 1659, gives the names of Mary, his wife, 
and children : Nathaniel, Ruth Whitney, Ta- 
bitha Abdy, Sarah Mason, and Mary Sanger. 
His will concludes with the statement, "I and 
my wife being stricken in age and are almost 
past our Labour." From this we must con- 
clude that he was born about 1590, and was 
either much older than his brother John, or 
that the latter was born earlier than 1612, 
the date of birth attributed to him. (See 
New Eng. His. & Gen. Reg., vol. ix, p. 137.) 
His only son Nathaniel removed to Bristol, 
Rhode Island, where the family still continues. 
The tombstone of Joseph, Nathaniel's son, 
still standing at Bristol, is well known as a 
fine example of early carving and shows the 
Reynolds coat of arms — three foxes .statant in 
pale proper, crest on an Esquire's helmet, a 
fox statant proper. 

John Reynolds' house as given in the map 
of Wethersfield was on High street, the third 
from the meeting .house and near the center 
of the town. This and other ]iroperty were 
recorded by him, "the 12th month and 11 
dale, 1640," and again recorded by John TTol- 
lister on 3m 2od 1644, as "bought of John 
Reynolds." 

It was not long before internal dissensions 
were disturbing the church at Wethersfield 



i826

and dividing inhabitants as well as the breth- 
ren. The Rev. Richard Denton became the 
leader of the more progressive and radical 
party. The ministers of the other churches of 
the river, and Mr. Davenport from New- 
Haven, successively tried to unite the fac- 
tions. The latter suggested the expediency 
of one of the parties removing and making a 
new settlement. At length a number of men 
who were the most pleased with the advice 
of Mr. Davenport and the New Haven breth- 
ren, and to whom the government of that 
colony was most agreeable, determined to re- 
move and settle in combination with New 
Haven. Nathaniel Turner had on July ist, 
1640, on behalf of the New Haven Colony, 
bought of Ponus, sagamore of Toquams, and 
of Wascussee, sagamore of Shippan, a tract 
of land which includes the present towns of 
Darien and Stamford and part of Greenwich 
paying about 33 pounds for a tract of land of 
one hundred and twenty-eight square miles. 
This tract, Rippowanis, Mr. Andrew Ward 
and I\Ir. Robert Coe, of Wethersfield, on 
October 30, 1640, purchased of the New Ha- 
ven Colony on behalf of themselves and about 
twenty other planters on these conditions: 
1st. The Wethersfield men were to give the 
price paid to the Indians for the land by Mr. 
Turner, and. A fifth part of the lands were 
to be reserved to be disposed of by the court 
to such other settlers as they saw fit. 3d. 
They were to join with the New Haven plan- 
tation in the form of government there 
adopted. Twenty men were to aettle in .Stam- 
ford by the last of November, 1641. 

It was decided that the majority of the 
seven church members, church membership 
being essential to becoming a freeman, should 
remove, with a minority of the planters and 
that they should take the church organization 
with them. Thirty men, among them John 
Revnolds, volunteered as pioneers of the new 
colony. These subscribed "100 bushels of 
corne" to be paid May or June, 1641, to the 
New Haven Colony, to make good the pur- 
chase price of the land, each man giving as 
he was able and receiving a proportional 
amount of land. In this subscription. Mr. 
Denton ranks third with 4.1 bu. : Jo. Rey- 
nolds, eighth with 3.2. bu. (Stamford Rec- 
ords, p. 5.) 

Of these thirty, twenty-eight removed to the 
site of Stamford in the summer of 1641. On 
October 19th they held their first meeting, 
electing five men to form a provisional gov- 
ernment and dividing the land between them. 
An account of this is to be found at Stam- 
ford in the earliest town record entitled "1640- 
41 a towne book of yc free holders of ye 



towne of Stamford as it was after wards 
called but now Rippowan, containing the acts 
and conclusions of the companie of Wethers- 
field men." At this meeting "the man under 
consideration absenting himself while his case 
was in hand and so successively and when 
he was called in again and demanded if so 
much gave him content and so content and 
satisfaction was by every one of these men 
acknowledged and they set down these num- 
bers of acres of marsh and upland after the 
same proportion that followeth xxx Mr. Den- 
ton 14 acres xxx John Renoulds 11 acres." 
(Stamford Records, p. 7.) 

The New Haven Colony had not been fully 
satisfied by the one hundred bushels of corn, 
so that an assessment was laid to make this 
good. The following is John Reynolds' ac- 
count : "For rate — now 56.10.0 and due at W. 
13. s. 6 d and to received Jo Renoulds 17 S. 
II d. makes 4. lbs. 08-3.,' each of whom sub- 
scribed a 'pick.' The next mention of him is 
in a list of twelve men. Here his name ap- 
pears as Jo. Renoulds. Latter is a tax list 
to make good the loss of the town mill and 
dam and for building a "captain's house.' 
'Jo. Reynoulds debtor for loss by mill 2 6 9, 
house 13 both 39.9 and he hath paid (for loss) 
at mill, First bill 9 s. 6. and dam .9 s. 3 s. 
house, 12 s. last charge 5. s. all 38 s. 6d.' " 

The last mention of him is in a deed recorded 
March, 1651, of property in the extreme west 
section of the town, near the site of Old 
Greenwich, bounded by "ye lot which was 
John Renoles." (Stamford Records, p. 51.) 

On page 55 of the original Stamford rec- 
ords is recorded the marriage of his daugh- 
ter: "Peter Ferris and Elizabeth RinealL- 
joyned ye 15 July, 1654." Her husband. Free- 
man, of Stamford, Connecticut, 1662, repre- 
sentative 1(567, was the son of Jeflfrey Fer- 
ris, one of the seven original proprietors of 
Greenwich, who had, like John Reynolds, re- 
moved successively from Watertown and 
Wethersfield to Stamford. They had the fol- 
lowing children: i. Joseph, son of Peter Fer- 
ris, b. 20-6-1657, (Stam. Rec. p. 74.) 2. Illeg- 
ible, son of Peter Ferris, illegible. 1659. 3. 
Elizabeth, dau. of Peter Ferris, b. 28-11-1659 
— d — 5-2-1660, Stamford Rec. p. 98. 4. Mary, 
dau. of Peter Ferris, b. May 2, 1662. (Stam. 
Rec. p. 76.) 5. Elizabeth, dau. of Peter Ferris, 
b. Jan. 2, 1664. (Stam. Rec. p. 76.) 

As Peter Ferris is mentioned as Sen. in 
the entry of his death, September 28, 1706, it 
is probable that the illegible name was Peter. 

On page 19 of the Stamford Records is en- 
tered the death of the wife of John: "Sarrah 
Reanolds died 3i-i()-i657." On page 20 a 
second entry gives it as "Sarra Reanols died

yQ 31 August 1657." We have records of 
only tliree of John's chiUhen : i. Lhzaheth, 
h. about 1634. 2. Jonathan, b. about 1636. 3. 
John, b. about 1638. 

'l"he subsequent history of John is unde- 
termined. A John Reynolds, often confused 
with him, was at Wethcrsfield as early as 
June 29, 1674, when he had by Naomi Lati- 
mer a son John, and a second son Jonathan. 
As Naomi Latimer was born April 4, 1648, he 
would have been appro.ximately thirty-six 
years older than his wife, and sixty-two years 
of age when the first child was born. These 
children are not to be confounded with the 
John and Jonathan of Greenwich, as the his- 
tories of all four are well known. It is said 
that only a few years ago there was at Weth- 
crsfield a tombstone to a certain John Rey- 
nolds who died in 1662. The constant recur- 
rence of the names John and Jonathan in the 
Greenwich and Wethersfield families implies 
an intimate connection. 

Jonathan, eldest son of John the Emigrant. 

The site of "Old Greenwich," now Sound 
Beach, lying some three miles to the west of 
Stamford, had been purchased from the In- 
dians on behalf of the New Haven Colony, 
on July 18, 1640, by Robert Peaks and Cap- 
tain Daniel Patrick, the latter a companion of 
Tohn Reynolds of W^atertown and Wethers- 
field 

About 1653 many of the settlers of Stam- 
ford had moved there, and among the earli- 
est inhabitants were Jonathan and John Rey- 
nolds, whose land lay along the Two Brothers' 
Brook, which fact probably suggested its 
name. 

Subsequently to 1653 the name of Jonathan 
Reynolds appears but once in the Stamford 
Records: "Jan. 7, 1666, Wm. Grimes for 
swearing veanly by ye name of God it being 
fully proved by Mr. Jones and Jonathan Re- 
nolds and Jos. Knapp ye said Grimes is fined 
ten shillings and to pay all charges of his be- 
ing to Stamford which is four shillings to each 
man." This Grimes at that time was an 
"Inhabitant" of Greenwich, as were the wit- 
nesses. 

In the Greenwich Town Records is an ac- 
count of a town meeting held February 5, 
1664, in which it was proposed to divide the 
■"conmion lands by a rule of proportion accord- 
ing to what each man's estate shall be visable." 
The proprietors are given as follows : "Jeflfre 
Ferris Sense, Joshua Knapp Sense, Joseph 
Ferris, Jonathan Reynolds, .\ngell Heus- 
ted, John Mead Sense, John Hobbe." These 
were termed the "Seven Proprietors." (Sense 
is an abbreviation for Senior.) 



One of the earliest deeds recorded at Green- 
wich (p. 3. vol. A.) is a bill of sale bearing 
date December 13, 1665, from Richard V'owles 
of Rye to Jonathan f^onalds, of Green- 
wich, of "seven acres of upland more or lesse 
which lieth within the compass of ye land 
that was called ye ox pasture, situate in Green- 
wich, bounded as followeth, northerly by ye 
hye way, westerly by Grimes land and south- 
erly by Joseph Ferrises land, Easterly by a 
Swamp, also three acres of Maddow more or 
less liounded southwest by Jonathan Ronaldoes 
land. North east by Joseph Ferris, Westerly 
by Joshua Knapps' land and Eastardly by 
Jonathan Ronoldes upland also a sartaine par- 
soli of upland XXX also my whole rite and 
interest Elizabeth Neck also my whole inter- 
est in land unto Myanos River." .Xt the bot- 
tom of the page is the following: 

I, Jonathan Ronalds do by this firndy ahsigne 
and make over this within bill of sale unto my 
Brother John Ronalds freely oneing and ac- 
knowledging the whole rite and interest in ye 
aforsayd bill of sale to be his to wit my brother 
John Reynolds and for a witness of ye truth of 
ye same I have set to my hand according to date 
within written, Jonathan Ronalds. 
In presence of 

Joseph Mead. 
Timothy Knapp. 

This bill and deed entered in the year of our 
Lord 1682. Februari 27. 

In 1667 Jonathan Reynolds was made a 
member of the .Assembly for Greenwich, and 
on October 24th, 1669, he was made a free- 
man of Connecticut by the Assembly of Green- 
wich. On December 28th, 1669, Jonathan Rey- 
nolds, Sargent Lockwood, John Hobby, Joshua 
Knapp, John Mead, and Joseph Mead, were 
appointed to free the town of all claims by 
Daniel Patrick, the son of Daniel Patrick, 
formerly Patroon of the Manor, who now ap- 
peared laying claims to his fathers land. The 
committee for the settlers who held by squat- 
ter sovereignty bought him off by paying a 
horse, saddle and bridle and fifty pounds. He 
served on various important committees for 
tlie laying out of lands, for making survey 
of Horseneck to see if it be suitable for the 
settlement of a township," as surveyor of 
highways, etc., all of which appointments are 
recorded in the Common Place Book of Green- 
wich. The following is a last mention of 
Jonathan in the Greenwich Records : ".\t 
town meeting 13, 12th month, Joshua Knapp 
is chosen to be a townman in the room of 
Jonathan Reynolds." No other business was 
considered at this meeting. The last previous 
meeting was November 13, 1673. ^^ is there- 
fore probable that he died in November or 
December, 1673. 

Letters of administration on his estate now

filed at Fairfield. Connecticut, January 23, 
1673-74, speak of him as "lately deceased," 
and mention his children : Jonathan R., about 
13 years: John R., about 11 years; Joseph 
R., about 4K' years: Rebecca R.. about 14 
years; Sarah R., aged 8 last November 6th; 
Elizabeth R., aged 6 last August. 

Apportionment was by Angell Heusted and 
Jonathan Knapp. He left a "widow Renals" 
and a total estate of three hundred and fifty- 
eight pounds. Inventory taken March 10, 
1673-74. Ebenezer, a posthumous child, was 
born in 1673. 

The apjiortionment was by Angell Heusted, 
and showed a total estate of three hundred and 
fifty-eight pounds. The will of Angell Heus- 
ted, also filed at Fairfield in 1706, mentions 
his "son-in-law Jonathan Renalds." It is 
possible that the "widow Renals" mentioned 
in the apportionment might have been a 
daughter of Heusted. While the above estate 
would not to-day be considered a large one, 
it was sufficient to place him second among 
the "Twenty-seven Proprietors of 1672," who 
purchased the Horseneck track, for at that 
time the rights in the distribution of land were 
based upon the wealth of the colonists. 

The following are the descendants of Jona- 
than Reynolds as far as they have been as- 
certained : unle:ss otherwise stated it may be 
assumed that they were all of Greenwich, 
Connecticut.

Eliphalet, b. about 1722. settled at Nine Part- 
ners, Dutchess CO., N. Y. 

The above dates, which have been obtained 
from the original records, do not agree as far 
as the day of the month is concerned with the 
genealogy of the children of Ebenezer. which 
dates are probably the dates of baptism. 

The above completes the"" descendants of 
Jonathan, the second child of the emigrant 
John, as far as they have been ascertained. 

JOHN REYNOLDS. (SECOND) .SON OF 
JOHN THE EMIGRANT. 

The first entry on the first page of the first 
book of deeds in Greenwich, February i, 1663, 
records the purchase from Angell Heusted of 
sixteen acres of land on the west side of the 
Myanos river, by John Ronalds, of Green- 
wich. This purchase was augmented by five 
pieces of land which Jonathan Ronalds had 
purchased of Richard \'owles, December 15, 
1665, and transferred on the same day to his 
"brother John Ronalds." 

On October 24, 1669, John was made free- 
man of Greenwich. 

On July 18, 1670, William Grimes left all 
his "lands to ye disposal of Joseph Mead, 
John Renals and Eliphalet Jones to be dis- 
|)osed of by tlicni in such a waye as they 
shall judge meet for ye inlarging of ye town

of Greenwich by accomodating such inhabitant 
or inhabitants as shall be admitted into ye 
town in an orderly way, provided they bee 
such men as ye afore sd Mead, Renols & Jones 
shall bee desirable for ye promoting of church 
& commonwealth." This William Grimes had 
on January 7, 1666, been fined for swearing 
and Jonathan Renolds had gone from Green- 
wich to Stamford to appear against him. It 
was not until March 7, 1694, that it was de- 
cided to dispose of the land "for ye use of a 
ministrie and if no ministrie be in ye place ye 
profit of sd land and meadow shall go to 
helpe maintain such as shall be employed in 
teaching children to reade." 

In 1669 John was appointed one of a com- 
mittee of five to purchase from the few re- 
maining Indians living about the west end of 
the town, the Horseneck tract three miles to 
the west of "Old Greenwich," from which it 
was separated by the Myanos river. The 
original settlers remained for the most part 
in the homelots at Old Greenwich and Horse- 
neck, now Greenwich, was largely settled by 
their children, who styled themselves as the 
" 27 Proprietors of 1672. " Among these 
Jonathan Reynolds ranked second and his 
brother John was the twenty-second among 
the proprietors. 

By the Greenwich inventory of 1688 it ap- 
pears that the number of "Inhabitants" had 
increased to fifty, among whom was John 
Reynolds, who was the wealthiest man. It 
would appear that his homelot adjoined the 
Church of the Second Society, for on Novem- 
ber 28, 1694, he was appointed "to supervise 
the building of a meeting house which is next 
his own house." His name constantly appears 
in the Greenwich Records up to the time of 
his death. John was appointed justice of the 
peace for Fairfield county, February 24, 1687, 
and King's Commissioner, 1690-97. 

His will, recorded in Fairfield, Connecticut, 
dated April 21, 1699, and a codicil dated No- 
vember 8, 1701, mentions his wife. Judah, and 
children John, Judah (or Judith), James, 
Mary, Jonathan, Joshua and David. At the 
time of his death in 1701 he was the wealthiest 
"Inhabitant" of Greenw^ich. The widow was 
appointed administratrix and the inventory 
was taken prior to December 17, 1701, when it 
was filed. The three distributors were all of 
Stamford. Joshua, the son of the deceased, 
chose his brother, John Reynolds, as guardian, 
while David chose Joseph Knapp as guardian. 
To James was given land next to Gearsham 
Lockwood. Joshua received land next to Jno. 
Heusted, and David land next to Joseph Fer- 
ris and Ephraim Palmer. The widow, his son 
John, and son-in-law Samuel Betts, were ap- 



pointed overseers. The daughter, Mary, had 
already received her portion. 

The town tax list of Greenwich in 1701-02 
contains the following of the name: 

Mr. John Renalls, 93 pounds; Sargent Jona- 
than Renalls. 22 pounds; Joseph, Jr., 5^ 
pounds: Jonathan. Jr.. 27 pounds; John, Jr., 72 
pounds; Ebenezer, 44 pounds; James, 46 pounds; 
John. Sr., 71 pounds. 

On February 4, 1701-02, the town made 
another distribution of land ; eighteen acres 
were allotted to "Mr. Renalds deceased."" He 
was the largest landholder in Greenwich at 
the time of his death, and this land was dis- 
tributed among his sons, who, in 1706, .sold 
to one another the various portions which 
their "honored father, Mr. John Renals de- 
ceased" had obtained from the many distribu- 
tions of town land, with the evident intention 
of concentrating their individual holdings. 

Judah, the wife of John, was probably the 
daughter of John Palmer, one of the early 
settlers of Greenwich. In the settlement of 
his estate recorded at Fairfield, Connecticut, 
the heirs of Judah Reynolds appear with Wil- 
liam, Ephraim, James and Joseph Palmer. 
John Palmer is stated to have "died many 
years ago." This bears the entry "due .August, 
1716," an addition was made to the inventory 
on April 17, 1778. 

Her mother's name was Judah, who w-as 
married after the death of John Palmer to 
JefTery Ferris, one of the two purchasers of 
Greenwich Point, July 18, 1640, w-hose will, 
executed January 6, 1664, recorded in Fair- 
field, mentions his wife, "Judy," who was his 
third wife. She receipted for her dower May 
6, 1667, as "Judah Bowers, lately widow 
Ferris, sometime wife to JefTery Ferris." 
Ferris left ten pounds apiece to the four 
"boies" of his wife, evidently the William, 
Ephraim, James and Joseph Palmer above 
mentioned. 

This is still further confirmed by the will of 
Ephraim^Palmer above mentioned, who died 
.August 19, 1684, and whose will is filed at 
Fairfield in book 1675-1689, page 140. The 
inventory was taken by John Reynolds : John 
Bowers was the administrator, and mentions 
his daughter Judith, aged 11 years. If the 
above relationship is correct, John Reynolds 
would have been the brother-in-law of Eph- 
raim Palmer, John Bowers would have been 
his stepfather, and his daughter, Judith, born 
in 1673, would have been named for his sister 
Judith, w-ife <>i John Reynolds, or for his 
mother. 

The will of John Bowers, of Greenwich, 
drawn March 16, 1693-94, gives property 
"that was her mother's to his daughter-in-law, 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



■835 



Mrs. Jiulah Reynold?," and again speaks of 
his "daughter Juda Reynolds and son Mr. 
John Ronalds." 

In Colonial times the stepchildren were re- 
ceived into the family and referred to as sons 
and daughters, thus in a deed dated April 
8, 1675, and recorded at Greenwich in Vol. 
A., p. 64, John Bowers gives land bounded by 
that of John Renalds to his son "Rpbraini 
Palmer." 

Judah, the wife of "Mr. John Ronalds," 
had her first child as early as 1670. As Su- 
sanna Lockwood, the second wife of Jeffery 
Ferris, did not die until Deceinber 23, 1660, 
she could not have been a daughter of Jeffery 
Ferris by his third marriage. Since Jeffery 
Ferris did not die until May 31, 1666, it is 
still less possible that she could have been a 
daughter of John Bowers. We are forced, 
therefore, to conclude that Judah Reynolds 
was the daughter of Judah by a marriage pre- 
vious to that to Jeffery Ferris, and the Palmer 
records above quoted make us consider the 
conclusion warranted that her father was John 
Palmer. 

John Bowers married, after the death of 
Judah, Hannah Knapp. widow of Joshua 
Knapp, the parents of Ruth, born 1667, who 
married John Reynolds, son of Jonathan, 
and of Joseph Knapp, who married Elizabeth, 
daughter of Jonathan Reynolds. 

John Reynolds and his wife, Judah Palmer, 
had the following children : 

I. John, born about 1670. 2. Judith, born 
about 1672. 3. James, born 1674. 4. Mary. 
5. Jonathan, 1682. 6. Joshua, born about 
1686. and 7. David, bom about 1689.

T. John was known as "The Cooper," and 
was born about 1670. He received from his 
father in 1695 his house and homelot at 
Horseneck. He died in December, 1732, and 
left a will in which he appointed his brother 
James and his son-in-law-, Samuel Mills, as 
his executors. He left the following children : 
I. Peter, born about 1695. 2. Judith, b. about 
1697. 3. David, b. about 1699. 4. Lydia and

His widow survived him, and was granted per- 
mission by the General Assembly, held in 
Hartford. May ist, 1751, to sell enough of his 
land to pay 598 pounds, which was the amount 
of his debts. The tax books of Greenwich 
show that his estate for the times was a very 
large one. He had the following children:

James— John — John. 

3. James Reynolds, son of Jnhn and his 
wife Judah, was born in Greenwich, in 1674, 
and on May 10, 1697, together with several 
others of "ye young men belonging to the 
towne," received an allotment of a homelot 
at Horseneck (three acres at Horseneck and 
ten between the Two Brothers' Brooks). 

Up to 1703 all town meetings had been held 
at Greenwich Old Towne, but in that year it 
was determined to hold half of them at Horse- 
neck, which was rapidly outgrowing in im- 
portance the older settlement, and James was 
one of those who signed the petition to the 
(General Assembly. In 1705 the town was 
divided into two societies, and he was ap- 
pointed selectman (Dec. 31, 1705) to the Sec- 
ond Societv on "ye West sd. of Mvanos 
River." 

In the Common Place liook at Greenwich 
is the entry: "Nov. i, 1706. Recorded unto 
James Renals his ear mark which is a cross 
upon ye top ye neer ear and two half pennies 
under ye side of ye same ear." 

James was elected lieutenant of the train 
band. May 14, 17 19, and captain May 9, 1728. 
1 Ic was the dcjiuty from Greenwich to the 
(k-neral Assembly, 1721-24, and 1727-38, and 
justice of the ])cace of Fairfield county, 1735- 
1741. Beginning with 1723 he was for many 
years the moderator of the Second Society. 
The last record of him in the books of the 
Society is dated December 7, 1750. 

That James Reynolds was a very large land 
holder is made apparent from the many deeds 
recorded in Greenwich. .\s early as April 21, 
1706, he obtained by grant of the town eight 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK \ALLEVS 



1837 



acres at Clap-board-tree-ridge, a hill lying 
about a mile and a half back of Greenwich. 
This was increased by purcliase from his 
brother John, December 2. 1712, and other 
grants November, 1707 and 171 2, until he 
owned a large tract. 

On March 14, 1710, he sold to Edward 
Avery "a piece of ground in Horscneck, my 
homelot of 14 acres with present dwelling, 
house barn and orchard bounded on the east 
by a highway, southerly and westerly by ye 
highway and northerly by ye land of Kbenczer 
Mead and common land." 

There was recorded at Wliiic Plains, De- 
cember 13, 1745, the deed from James Rey- 
nolds an<l three co-partners of a very large 
tract of land in Westchester coimty, held "by 
virtue of patent granted in 1701 and called the 
East Patent." 

On ?klay 10, 1736, he deeded his "well be- 
loved and dutiful son Gideon Reynolds" a 
very large tract of land on Clap-board-tree- 
ridge, and augmented it with another granted 
February 21st, 1743. On April 29, 1738, he 
deeded part of his "homelot in Greenwich to 
his loving and dutiful son Justus." On Sep- 
tember 24, 1748, he gave his son Jeremiah 
fifty acres. On February 17, 1748-49, he 
gave his son. James Jr.. his house and or- 
chard on Clap-board-tree-ridge. This house, 
a large gambrel structure surrounded by enor- 
mous box trees, was still standing in 1897, and 
was owned by the descendants of Gideon Rey- 
nolds. On March 4, 1752, he deeded his lands 
on the Indian Fields to his sons James Jr. and 
Gideon, both of Greenwich. On Afarch 24, 
1752. he gave his lands at North Castle to 
his son James Jr. 

From the distribution of his property it is 
apparent that lie intended moving from Green- 
wich to New York state, where he was prob- 
ably interested in the Nine Partners Patent. 
He figures in the Greenwich tax lists as late 
as 1761. and in deeds describes himself as of 
Greenwich in 1759-61-62. 

Nevertheless, his granddaughter .\nna Pal- 
mer, daughter of Nathaniel Reynolds, deeded, 
October i, 1760, land on Clap-l)oard-tree- 
ridge, "in said Greenwich, which was given to 
her by her honored grandfather James Rey- 
nolds formerly of said Greenwich but now of 
Dutchess in the Province of New York." 
(Greenwich Deeds, vol. ^'TH.) 

James, in a deed dated August, 1761, de- 
.scribes himself as of Peekskill, in the county 
of Westchester. James died February 14, 
1767, at Amenia. Dutchess county, N. Y., 
and was buried in the .\menia City (Smith- 
field) graveyard, where his stone still exists. 
I-\imil\- tradition states that he was visiting 



his son James, who is also buried there. A 
letter written in 1848 states that "he was 
large and made a fine appearance." 

From a deed signed December 22, 1731, by 
Captain James Reynolds and liis wife Sarah, 
it appears that she was the daughter of Mary 
Hobby, who married, November 18, 1686 
(Stamford Records, p. 118), Stephen Holmes 
(b. Jan. 14, 1664-65, at Stamford, d. May 15, 
1710, Greenwich). The deed (Greenwich, 
vol. A, p. 131) covers "part of lot or right 
of land that was given by John Hobby of 
Greenwich, deceased, unto his daughter Mary 
and her children, and I, Sarah Renyalls, am 
one of the children of ye said Mary Holmes." 
The said land was granted to her by her hon- 
ored father John Hobby "Dec. 22, .-Kuno Dom.. 
1 73 1." The latter was on the voters' list of 
Greenwich as early as 1658, and the inventory 
of his estate, April 24, 1707, mentions "dau. 
Mary Holmes, wife of Stephen Holmes." 
John Hobby was the son of John Hobby, one 
of the seven original proprietors of Green- 
wich (1664). 

Stephen Holmes, b. Jan. 14, 1664-5. 'n 
Stamford (Stamford Records, p. 76), d. May 
15, 1710, in Greenwich (Stamford Records, p. 
143), was the son of John Holmes, b. 1635, 
d. July 6, 1703 (Stamford Records, p. 113), 
and Rachel Waterbury, who removed to Bed- 
ford, Westchester county, N. Y., in 1680. 
They were married at Stamford, Dec. 3, 1659 
(Stamford Records, p. 76). Rachel Water- 
bury was the daughter of John Waterbury, 
who died at Stamford 3- 15- 1658 (Stamford 
Records, p. 20). John Holmes receipted on 
behalf of his wife "Rachel out of ye estate 
of her deceased father John Waterbury 10- 
I2m-i668" (Stamford Records, p. 68). 

The Common Place Book at Greenwich 
gives the births of four of James' children: 
"Sarah Renalds ye daughter of James Renals

Nathaniel — James — John — John. 

3. Nathaniel was born at Greenwich. Feb. 20, 
1702-3, where his birth is given in the Com- 
mon Place Book. While the Greenwich Rec- 
ords of this period make constant mention of a 
Nathaniel Reynolds, it is not always impossi- 
ble to determine which refer to him and which 
to Nathaniel, b. 1715, son of Ebenezer. 

He, together with Joshua, Peter and James 
Jr., petitioned the General Assembly in 1753 
to be "set off from the Parish of Stanvvich in 
the South \\^est of which they lived and to be 
joined to the Parish of Horseneck." 1 le was 
elected constable for Greenwich, Dec. 27, 

1728. The records of the Second Church at 
Greenwich contain the record of his marriage. 
"On ye first day of January 1728-9 Nathaniel 
Reynolds was married to his wife Ruth whose 
name was Purdy." The Greenwich Common 
Place Book gives the births of two of his chil- 
dren : "Nathaniel Rcnalds' children : Dec. 8, 

1729, Nathaniel: Ian. 8. 1751. Frances Ren- 
yalls." 

At a court of probate held in Stamford 
June 7, 1748. letters of administration were 
granted on the estate of Nathaniel Reynolds, 
late of Greenwich, deceased, and Ruth his 
widow was appointed administratrix. Dis- 
tribution was made April 7, 1752 ; after paying 
debts amounting to 580 pounds there remained 
for tlie children 413 pounds and a large 
amount of real estate. His children are stated 
to be Nathaniel, Francis, Solomon, Stephen, 
Ruth, Anna and Hannah. 

In Vol. 7, p. 67, of the Greenwich Deeds, 
is recorded the following: "Know all men 
that I, James Reynolds, Senior, of Greenwich, 
in consideration of the love I have for my 
grandsons, namely, Nathaniel Reynolds, Fran- 
cis Reynolds, Stephen Reynolds, and Solomon 
Reynolds, all natural sons to Nathaniel Rey- 
nolds, of Greenwich, and also by the love and 
good will I bear to their natural mother, Ruth 
Reynolds, widow and relect of the deceased 
Nathaniel," etc., Feb. 2. 1749-50. 

Ruth Purdy belonged to the well known 
family of Rye, N. Y. Francis Purdy in a 
deed of 1718 was described as "of Green- 
wich," as was John Purdy in 1727. .\s Ruth 



1840 



HL^nSOX AND MOHAWK \ ALLEYS 



was married in Greenwich and had a son 
Francis, the probability is that she was a 
daughter of Francis Purdy. Both John and 
Francis were sons of Joseph Purdy, who ap- 
peared at Rye in 1677. He was the son of Fran- 
cis, who was an early inhabitant of Fairfield, 
Conn., and died in 1658. The Purdy genealogy 
in the "History of Rye" is incomplete, and that 
of P.olton is obviously inaccurate. To deter- 
mine the line of descent will necessitate a study 
of the original town records. 

Ruth, after the death of Nathaniel, married 
Jonathan Fiske, of Greenwich. In the distri- 
bution of his estate recorded at Stamford, 
July 21, 1762, mention is made of the use 
by his widow of one third part of said de- 
scribed lands, being conveyed to said widow 
by her father-in-law, Mr. James Reynolds, in 
part, and partly came by her husband. Nathan- 
iel Reynolds, deceased. 

Nathaniel had the following descendants: 
I. Nathaniel, b. Dec. 8, 1729, removed to Cross 
River, Westchester co., N. Y. Letters of ad- 
ministration which were granted to his son 
Nathaniel. Dec. 23, 1805, describe him as a 
resident of Salem, Westchester county, N. Y. 
He had : 1. Nathaniel, b. in Cross River, Feb. 
22, 1754, m. Oct. 15, 1778, Hannah Todd (the 
widow Cooley), who was born May 26, 1759, 
d. Apr. 1 1, 1846. He was a second lieutenant 
of the 3rd Regiment of Westchester county 
militia, commanded by Col. Samuel Drake, and 
was taken prisoner June 24, 1779, released 
Oct. 24, 1 78 1. 

In his will, drawn December 20th, 1839, 
probated Jan. 22, 1844, at White Plains, he 
describes himself as being of South Salem, 
X. Y. He died Sept. 21, 1843, and had: i. 
Deborah, b. July 17, 1779, d. May 24. 1844, m.

Nathaniel and his wife Kutli I'urdy also 
had: 2. F'rancis, b. July 8, 1731. Nothing 
is known of his descendants. There was a 
h'rancis Reynolds who lived at Crum Elbow, 
Dutchess county, N. Y., at this time, and it is 
probable that they were identical. 3. Ruth, 

b. about 1733, m. Merritt, and in 1760 

she was living on the property at Clap-board- 
tree-ridge given her by her grandfather 
James. 4. Solomon, b. about 1735, nothing is 
known of his descendants. There was a Solo- 
mon who lived at Poundridge, N. Y., another 
at Crum Elbow, N. Y., and one at Woodbury, 
Conn., 5. Anna, b. about 1737, m. Samuel Pal- 
mer. In a deed recorded at Greenwich in 
\'ol 8. dated Feb. 25, 1760, "Samuel Palmer 
and Anna Palmer his wife of Greenwich sells 
to David Knapp two acres in said Greenwich 
which was given to the said Anna by her hon- 
ored grandfather James Reynolds, formerly 
of said Greenwich, but now of Dutchess in the 
province of New York a lot on Clap-board- 
tree-ridge, bounded east by our sister Mer- 
ritts, west by our sister Hannah Fiske." Their 
descendants lived in Westchester county. 6. 
Stephen, b. Dec. 31, 1740 (for his descendants 
see hereinafter), 7. Hannah, m. July 21, 1762, 
Jonathan Fiske, the son of Jonathan Fiske, 
who married her widowed mother Ruth 
Purdy. Their descendants reside in Saratoga 
county and at Troy, N. Y. 

Stephen— Nathaniel — James — John — John. 

In a deed recorded at Greenwich, vol. ix, p. 
S2. Feb. 2, 1762, Stephen described himself as 
of "'Woodbury, county Litchfield," and sells 
to Jonathan Fiske his share of his father Na- 
thaniel's estate and of his grandfather's James 
Reynolds' of Dutchess county, N. Y. The 
fact that he removed to Woodbury, Connecti- 
cut, as soon as he had reached his majority, 
coupled with the fact that there w-as a Solo- 
mon there residing, makes the identification of 
the latter with Solomon, son of Nathaniel, 
more than probable. The Woodbury family 
of Reynolds are attributed without apparent 
authority to John of Wethersfield. (Note. 
.A.ll of the data from the time that Stephen left 
Woodbury are derived from family records.) 

Stephen removed to Amenia City, Dutchess 
county, prior to 1763. where his uncle James 
lived, and where his grandfather James died, 
and erected in 1764 a residence on the old Al- 
bany post road and about a half mile to the 
north of the Amenia City (Smithfield) 
Church. This contained three rooms of the 
entire width of the house, with kitchens and 
dependences behind. It was of frame, and a 
storv and a half high. It was torn down in 
1877. 

He is probably identical with the Stephen

Reynolds who enlisted in the Continental 
Army, Capt. Daniel Shepard's company (see 
"New York in the Revolution," pp. 259-454) 
during the Revolution, in the New York forces, 
since there is no record of any other Stephen 
of an age which would have made it possible 
for him to take part in this war. He died in 
Amenia, August 17, 1815, and is buried in 
the "City" (Smithfield) graveyard. His will 
is recorded in Poughkeepsie, N. Y. 

He married. Amenia, N. Y., February ist, 
1763, Rachel Denton. She was born April 12, 
1742 (o. s. ), and died in Albany, N. Y., No- 
vember 10, 1815, while on her way to visit 
her son Stephen, at Minaville, N. Y., and was 
buried in one of the church burial grounds in 
.■Mbany, and in 1856 her remains were trans- 
ferred to the Reynolds plot in the Albany 
Rural Cemetery. Her father was Benjamin 
Denton, of Foster's Meadows, Wallingford, 
Connecticut, also of Farmington, Connecticut, 
and Amenia, New Y^ork : married at Farm- 
ington, December i, 1724, Rachel Wheeler, of 
Hartford, Connecticut. He was the son of 
Richard Denton (died in 1699), the son of 
Nathaniel Denton, of Jamaica, L. I., the son 
of Richard Denton, of Halifax, England, 
(born in 1586), a clergyman, a graduate of 
Cambridge University in 1623, who came to 
America in 1634 and settled in Watertown, 
Connecticut. He led those colonists who 
founded the settlement at Wethersfield and 
subsequently removed to Stamford, with the 
first settlers. Cotton Mather eulogizes him 
in his Magnala. He removed to Long Island, 
returned to England and died there. 

Stephen and his wife Rachel Denton had

Marcus Tullius — Stephen — Stephen — 
Nathaniel — James — John — John. 

I. Marcus Tullius. son of Dr. Stephen Rey- 
nolds and Lydia Bartlett, was born in Mina- 
ville, Florida township, Montgomery county, 
N. Y., December 29, 1788; died at his resi- 
dence. No. 25 No. Pearl street, Albany, N. Y,, 
July II, 1864, and was buried in the Albany 
Rural Cemetery. 

When he was ten years of age he was sent 
to the high school at Canajoharie, N. Y., 
where he remained three years, and on leaving 
there he entered a collegiate school at Utica, 
where he was fitted for college. In 1805 he 
entered Union College, and was graduated, 
ranking second in the class of 1808. He was 
an excellent classical student, and also en- 
joyed the study of philosophy. He began the 
study of law in the office of Matthias B. Hil- 
dreth, of Johnstown, Fulton county. New 
York, who was many years the attorney gen- 
eral of New York state. He was admitted to 
the bar February 14, 181 1, and early evinced 
those talents which enabled him to advance 
rapidly. He practiced at Johnstow-n for sev- 
enteen years, where he was compelled to con- 
tend with the talented lawyer, David Cady. In 
May, 1828, he removed to Albany, N. Y., 
where he passed the remainder of his life. 

"From the year 1837 down to the adoption 
of the Code of Procedure, Marcus T. Rey- 
nolds, Samuel Stevens and Nicholas Hill were 
regarded impartially as the three most prom- 
inent lawyers in New York state. It was 
said that a reference to the reports of cases 
argued in the appellate courts of the state 
from 1817 to 1853, when he retired, will show 
that Marcus T. Reynolds was counsel in more 
cases adjudicated in the supreme court and the 
court for the correction of errors than al- 



most any other lawyer of this state. During 
a period of twenty-six years he was second 
to none as a barrister, and the story of his 
career during that time is the history of the 
supreme court, court of correction of errors 
and the court of appeals, 

"He had the faculty of passing from grave 
to gay, from lively to severe, with surprising 
facility. He carried his cases by being thor- 
oughly imbued with them himself, and then, 
by a clear and well defined statement to the 
court and jury, imparting the impression that 
he had no doubt of the right of his case. Be- 
fore a jury he had a sort of magnetic power, 
by which he photographed his own ideas and 
reasons upon the minds of the jury." (See 
Proctor's "Bench and Bar," and "Proceed- 
ings of the Albany Bar on the Death of Mar- 
cus T. Revnolds," Albany Evening Journal, 
July 15, 1864, 

He was confirmed by the senate as justice 
of supreme court, July 7, 1849, and was also 
elected congressman. Within a year or two of 
the operation of the first passenger railway 
train, in 1831, he became concerned in the 
organization of steam roads, and when on 
May 5, 1836, several small lines consolidated 
as the Albany & West Stockbridge railroad, 
the last line to the west of what later be- 
came the Boston & Albany road, he was 
elected president of the new company. He 
was also chosen president of the Utica & 
Schenectady railroad, later merged into the 
New York Central lines, and was president of 
the .Albany & Northern railroad. He was 
a director of the .-Mbany Insurance Company 
from 1835 to 1863 : a director of the New 
York State Bank from June, 1840, to July, 
1861 : a founder of the Albany Hospital, or- 
ganized in 1849; a founder and trustee of the 
Albany Orphan Asylum, organized May 19, 
1830; an organizer and fourth largest con- 
tributor to the Albany Rural Cemetery, and 
one of the largest contributors to the found- 
ing of the Dudley Observatory in 1852 : 
elected a vestryman of St, Peter's Episcopal 
Church in 1842, and advanced to warden in 
1843, serving through i860, and chairman of 
its most important committees, e. g., March 
25, 1845, to sell the church land on Maiden 
Lane, Pine and Lodge streets : 1845, to pro- 
cure a new rectory: 1855, to secure funds for 
the new church edifice which was consecrated 
October 4, i860. 

He resided a long time at No. 7 Park Place. 
.Albany, which site was taken about 1870 for 
the new capitol. His last residence was at 
the south east corner of Maiden Lane and 
Pearl street, where he practiced law and lived 
with his familv.

Many years before his deafh he was thrown 
from his horse, the fall producing an injury 
to one of his knee-pans, of such serious na- 
ture that amputation became necessary. He 
was immediately carried into a store, where 
a skilled surgeon determined that an opera- 
tion must inevitably follow, stating further 
that perhaps it had better be done on the 
following day. "I wish you to proceed in- 
stantly, for I cannot have the matter upon 
my mind," said Mr. Reynolds. The surgeon 
obeyed. This was before the day of either 
chloroform or ether, but the patient sub- 
mitted without a groan. From this time on 
he generally conducted his cases sitting. 

Marcus T. Reynolds married (first) Cyn- 
thia Herrick, born at Amenia, Dutchess 
county, N. Y., December 26, 1794. died at

December 8, 1778, aged 47, who was the sis- 
ter of Rachel Denton, the wife of Stephen 
Reynolds, where her ancestry is given. All 
of the above are buried at the City grave- 
yard (now Smithfield), Dutchess county. N. 
v., where the inscriptions were copied in 
1897. 

The mother of Cynthia Herrick was Cyn- 
thia Brush, who died at Amenia City, Nov. 19, 
1815, aged 50. Cynthia Brush was the daugh- 
ter of Richard Brush, of Amenia, who made 
his will August 27, 1795. leaving "all real 
estate to Richard Brush Herrick, the pres- 
ent youngest son of Benjamin Herrick." The 
same document mentions his wife Hannah, 
and is copied in a Greenwich, Connecticut, 
deed. Here also is entered his birth record, 
"Richard Brush had a son Dec. 17, 1727, 
named him Richard." The Herrick home- 
stead at Amenia adjoined on the north that 
of Stephen Reynolds.

thur, who was an intimate friend in later 
years. He graduated July 26, 1848, ranking 
second in his class of 120, and was honored 
with the Latin salutatory. He attended the 
Lawrence Scientific School at Cambridge, 
Mass., the year of its founding, 1848-9, and 
was a graduate of the Harvard Law School, 
class of 1850. He was admitted to the bar 
at Albany, December 2, 1851, and in 1853 
wrote the volume published by Gould, Banks 
& Co., Albany. 1853, "A Treatise on the Law 
of Life Assurance." He formed a partner- 
ship with Orlando Meads. Afterwards he 
was in partnership with John Olcott, son of 
Thomas Worth Olcott. the banker. Later on 
he was associated with the law firm of M. T. 
& L. G. Hun, nephews, at 25 No. Pearl street. 
With his friends, Erastus Corning and J. 
Howard King, he made a nuinbcr of visits to 
Western states on inmtiiiii trips, and it was 



then he purchased large tracts of land in 
Iowa e(|ual in extent to nearly half the area 
of that state. His final sale in closing the in- 
vestment was 210,000 acres. In the Civil War 
he was paymaster of the Third Regiment, and 
went to Richmond, X'irginia, under Gen. Fred- 
erick Townsend, commanding. 

His patented inventions numbered twenty 
or more, and each of these was among the 
pioneers of very important lines. He first 
gave considerable study to the manufacture of 
paper from wood pulp at a time such processes 
were not practical or paying. In 1858 he pub- 
lished a treatise on the subject. His investi- 
gation was most thorough, and gave an im- 
petus to the trade at a time of di.scouragement. 

-Among the earliest .of his inventions was a 
typesetter, which he manufactured in Roch- 
ester, previous to 1875, and followed this with 
an automatic distributor, which was the first 
attempt to di.stribute movable type by 
machine. In this comiection he invented the 
notching of type. It was placed in a publish- 
ing house in Albany about 1876, and was dis- 
countenanced by the printers, who saw their 
means of support about to disappear through a 
saving to the employer. The theory of this 
machine was utilized by a manufacturer of 
such machines, and a tedious lawsuit for in- 
fringement resulted, which was finally com- 
promised. A direct steel and wrought iron 
process occupied his attention for some twenty 
years, which led to an experimental furnace 
erected in the early spring of 1903, which was 
the first to nodulize fine ores in a revolving 
cylindrical furnace, which ores had hitherto 
been of value only when briquetted. This proc- 
ess, the furnaces now enlarged to over a hun- 
dred feet, is in general use throughout the 
country for nodulizing flue dust and magneti- 
cally separated ores. 

Dexter Reynolds married, at Rochester, N. 
Y., April 19, 1865. Catherine Maley Cuyler 
(see Cuyler Family). Rev. R. Bethell Clax- 
ton, of St. Luke's Episcopal Church, officiat- 
ing. They resided at 20 Elk street, Albany, 
N. Y. She was born in Cuylerville, Living- 
ston county, N. Y., December 2. 1845 ; was 
educated at a boarding school in Utica, X. \'., 
died while visiting in Rochester, October 23, 
1875, and was buried in the Reynolds lot in 
the Albany Rural Cemetery. Her father was 
Col. William Tremper Cuyler, who was born 
in Albany, December 22, 1802, died in Cuy- 
lerville, N. Y., December 21, 1864, and was 
the .son of John Cornelius Cuyler (born in 
Schenectady, N. Y., Dec. 5, 1766, died there 
October 25, 1828), and Hannah Maley (b. 
Oct. 12. 1769). Her mother was Nancy 
I'.ancker Stewart, who was born in Leicester,

N. Y., Feb., 1810, died Feb. 3, 1848. and 
was daughter of John Stewart and Nancy 
Bancker Clute (born in Schenectady, N. Y., 
Dec. 25, 1776, died in Moscow, N. Y., Apr. 
28, 1864). Dexter Reynolds and Catherine 
Maley Cuyler had children — Cnyler and Mar- 
cus Tullius. 

Cuyler Reynolds, son of Dexter Reynolds 
and Catherine Maley Cuyler. was born at 98 
Columbia street, Albany. N. Y., August 14, 
1866. At the Albany Academy and a board- 
ing school in Catskill, N. Y., he received his 
education, which developed particularly his 
faculties as a writer, establishing in 1885 the 
school paper, of which he was made its editor- 
in-chief. He engaged in newspaper work 
and followed it some fifteen years, at the same 
time contributing to more than a score of 
the better magazines. Turning his attention 
then to the writing of books, novels and ref- 
erence works, he produced ten or more, the 
most valuable of which were his "Classified 
Quotations," Putnam, 1905, and "Albany 
Chronicles," 1907, the latter a volume so com- 
prehensive and copiously illustrated that it is 
likely to endure and be cited as one of the best 
authorities of state history. Later he be- 
came editor-in-chief of the "Hudson-Mohawk 
Genealogical and Family Memoirs," in four 
octavo volumes. 

By a scientific study and enumeration of 
the letters of the alphabet as they occurred 
in books, magazines and newspapers, he ar- 
ranged a table of the recurrence of letters, 
which results he set forth in a monograph 
entitled "The Recurrence of Letters," read be- 
fore the Albany Institute in 1894, then pub- 
lished in Paper and Press in 1895, and while 
it served as a key for the solution of ciphers 
or secret writing, its more practical use was 
in its application to the keyboards of type- 
setting machines, and in this form is univer- 
sally used. 

Much interested in historical research, es- 
pecially as it concerned his home city, he was 
made director of the Albany Institute and His- 
torical and Art Society at its annual meeting 
in 1899, and continued as such for ten years. 
He made for this society several of its most 
noteworthy collections, numbering a dozen or 
more, at the same time filling the office of 
librarian. As librarian, he gathered nearly 
one thousand books written by Albanians, 
which list composed a biographical catalogue 
of 114 pages in 1902. The opening of this in- 
stitution's new building. May 12, 1908. gave 
him opportunity to originate the novel sys- 
tem of indexing and the method of keeping 
the various record books. 

In March, 1907, he received the appoint- 



ment of director of the New York State His- 
tory Exhibit for the Jamestown Exposition; 
collected and installed it in systematic order, 
the features of which he set forth in an elab- 
orately illustrated Catalogue of Exhibit, with 
the Exposition's Gold Medal as the result. 
Afterwards he wrote the State's report, a 
handsome volume, copiously illustrated, and 
of about five hundred pages, published in 
1910. 

He was elected to honorary membership 
in the American Scenic and Historic Preser- 
vation Society in 1908, and in the New York 
State Historical Association in 1909. He is 
also a member of the National Geographic 
Society, American Historical Association and 
of the American Copyright League. He has 
resided all his life in Albany. 

He married, at the Cathedral of All Saints, 
Albany, N. Y., Dean Wilford L. Robbins offi- 
ciating, September 24, 1891, Janet Gray 
Gould. -She was born in Albany, July 22, 
1871, and was educated at the .'\lbany Female 
Academy. Her father was Captain Charles 
Gould, born in Albany, October 28, 1848, died 
in Albany, July 4, 1896, who was the son of 
William Gould (b. in Caldwell, N. J., Nov.

HISTORICAL APPENDIX 



ALBANY COUNTY. 



The original counties into which the New 
York colony was divided numbered twelve. 
The division was made pursuant to the act 
of 1683. The twelve counties were then named 
Albany, Cornwall, Dukes, Dutchess, Kings, 
New York, Orange, Queens, Richmond, Suf- 
folk, Ulster and West Chester. 

It may seem strange in these times, but 
Cornwall county consisted of the district 
known then as Pemaquid, now in Maine, and 
Dukes county was composed of some islands 
off Massachusetts. This was because this land 
was included in the patent of the Duke of 
York and Albany. They were detached 
in 1 69 1, upon reorganization of the govern- 
ment. 

On October 17, 1683, the first "General 
Assembly of the Colony of New York," chosen 
by "the planters or inhabitants of every part 
of the government," met at Fort James in the 
city of New York, with "free liberty to con- 
sult and debate among themselves all matters 
as shall be apprehended proper to be estab- 
lished for laws for the good of the govern- 
ment of the said Colony of New York and 
its dependencyes." 

In preparation for this meeting, it was 
"ordered that the Sheriff of Albany and Ran- 
celaers Colony cause the freeholders to meet 
and choose two persons to be their repre- 
sentatives in the General Assembly, to be 
holden at the City of New York, October ve 
17th, 1683." 

.\mong the acts bearing the date November 
I, 1683, resultant of the meeting mentioned, 
was one "To divide this province and depen- 
dencyes into shires and countyes * * * 
for tlic better governing and settling the courts 
in the same." 

This act having specified the twelve origi- 
nal counties, defined "The County of Albany 
to containe the Towns of .Albany, the Collony 
Renslaerwyck, Schonectcda. and all the vil- 
lages, neighborhoods, and Christian Planta- 



cons on the east side of Hudson River from 
Roelof Jansen's Creeke, and on the west side 
from Sawyer's Creeke to the Sarraghtoga." 
Attention is called to the fact that the names 
of the original counties were distinctively 
English in their derivation ; but after the 
Revolution, when new divisions were made 
so as to split the original into more numerous 
and smaller counties, the names bestowed 
were indicative of the Indians who had been 
associated with certain sections, or else 
honored the name of American patriots. 




When the Council held a session at Fort 
William Henry in New York City. October 
I, 1 69 1, the previous Act was confirmed; but 
in describing the County of Albany, there was 
an omission of "the Town of Albany," and a 
substitution of "Mannor of Ranslaerswyck" 
for the "Collony of Renslaerwyck," as well 
as an extension, "to the uttermost end of 
Sarraghtoga," instead of "to the Sarraghtoga." 

At the Council's session held at Fort 
George, in New York City, May 27, 1717, the 
area of Albany county was enlarged further 
by "An Act for annexing that part of the 
Mannor of Livingston which now lyes in 
Dutchess Cnuntv. unto the Coinitv of .\lbanv." 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



The counties of Dukes, consisting of Nan- 
tucket, Martha's Vineyard, Ehsabeth Island 
and No Man's Land (now in Massachusetts) 
and Cornwall, consisting of Pemaquid and ad- 
jacent lands and islands (now in Maine), 
which lands were included in the patent given 
to the Duke of York, were set off upon the 
reorganization of the colonial government, 
about 1691, or soon after the abdication of 
King James IL, and the succession of William 
and Mary to the English throne. 

There were but few changes in the ten orig- 
inal counties left within the borders of New 
York until the year 1770. It is surprising 
what the real extent of Albany county was in 
those days. It embraced the whole territory 
lying north of Ulster county, west of the 
Hudson River, and it took in nearly the whole 
State, going northward to the lakes and Can- 
ada ; and north of Dutchess, on the east side 
of that river, including the entire State of 
Vermont. Plainly stated, within the bounds 
of Albany county were the State of Vermont 
and the fifty counties of the State of New 
York erected since the 1683-1691 period men- 
tioned, excepting Putnam, Sullivan, Rockland, 
and part of Greene and Delaware. 

The ten counties formed directly from Al- 
bany county, and before some of them were 
again subdivided into other counties, were : 

(i) Gloucester, March 16, 1770; included 
what is now Orange, Washington, Caledonia, 
Orleans, and Essex, X'crmont. 

(2) Tryon, March 12, 1772: changed to 



Montgomery, April 2, 1784. from which and 
the wilderness then known only as land of the 
Indians, the counties west of Greene, Scho- 
harie, Schenectady, Saratoga, and the Adiron- 
dack counties have since been formed. 

(3) Charlotte, March 12, 1772; changed to 
Washington. April 2, 1784, from whose terri- 
tory have since been erected Warren, Clinton, 
St. Lawrence, Essex and Franklin. 

(4) Cumberland, April 4, 1786: covering 
the present counties of Bennington, Windsor, 
Windham, Rutland, Addison and Chittenden, 
in \'ermont. 

(5) Columbia, April 4, 1786. 

(6) Rensselaer, February 7, 1791. 

(7) Saratoga, February 7, 1791. 

(8) Schoharie, April 6, 1795. 

(9) Greene, March 25. 1800. 

( 10) Schenectady, March 7, 1809. 

.Albany county, in 1900, was bounded as fol- 
lows : On the north, by the counties of Sara- 
toga and Schenectady ; on the west, by the 
county of Schoharie ; on the south, by Greene 
county, and on the east by Rensselaer county. 

The eastern boundary is very marked, being 
the Hudson river, flowing between Albany 
and Rensselaer counties, '"a line drawn 
through the middle of the main stream * * * 
with such variations as to include the islands 
!)ing nearest to the west bank thereof." 

The northern boundary, between .Vlbany 
and Saratoga counties, "made by a line be- 
ginning at a point in the middle of the main 
stream of tlie Hudson River in the westerly 




Map of 1614.

boundary of Rensselaer cmnity, opposite to of the said Mohawk River, westerly, to a point 

the middle of the most nortiierly branch of in said river where it is nearest the north 

the Mohawk River, and running thence line of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, at 

throutrh the middle of said northerly branch Xiskayuna." 



CITIES AND TOWNS. 



Albany. — The city was incorporated by 
patent issued by Lieut. -Gov. Thomas Dongan. 
July 22, 1686, and is the oldest existing char- 
tered city in the United States. 

Its history, in its wealth of details covering 
three centuries, is of interest equal to that of 
any other in the country, and a resume of it 
merits attention. 

Giovanni de Verrazano, an expert Italian 
navigator, commissioned by Francis I., to 
seek a direct route to the East Indies, sailed 
in 1523, aboard La Dauphine, with about fifty 
men, from Dieppe, France, and entered New 
York Bay in 1524; but after making investi- 
gation, did not pursue his course up the river. 

In 1540, a small band of French fur-traders, 
bent on bartering with the Indians, sailed up 
the river and erected a stone "castle," or forti- 
fied trading-post, 26 x 36 feet, on an island at 
the southern boundary of the present city of 
Albany. Their records were so meagre that 
they have not been accorded due fame as the 
first white men to sail up the Hudson river'. 

Henry Hudson, an English navigator, was 
employed by the Dutch East India Co., under 
contract dated January 8, 1609, to explore the 
Grande (Hudson) river, noticed by him on 
a French map, and he sailed on the Half 
Moon from the Texel river, Holland, March 
25th of that year. He entered New York Bay 
September 3rd : passed through the Narrows 
on the 6th, and it is calculated that he reached 
the site of Albany on September 19th, where 
he anchored and investigated, until he decided 
to sail down the river on .September 23rd. 
His record is preserved. 

The Lords States-General at The Hague, 
Holland, on October 11, 1614, granted a li- 
cense to fur-traders to traffic with natives in 
New Netherland, who send Hendrik Cor- 
stiaensen, of Amsterdam, in 161 5, and he re- 
builds the "castle," which tlic fur-traders of 
1540 had erected on the island immediately 
south of Albany, calling it Fort Nassau, which 
was wrecked by the freshet of 1618. and 
abandoned. 



The Dutch West India Co. was incorpor- 
ated under the seal of Lords States-General of 
Holland, June 3, 1621, intending to colonize 
or trade in America. The Walloons, or perse- 
cuted French Protestants who had fled to 
Belgium, liked by the Dutch because of their 
thrift, petitioned this company, February 5, 

1622. to be allowed to settle along the Hud- 
son river. They were given permission in 

1623, and in March, 1624, thirty families 
sailed on the New Netherland, commanded by 
Captain Cornells J. Mey, and entered New 
York Bay in May. They proceeded up the 
river to the site of Albany; building Fort 
Orange close to the western shore, in com- 
mand of which they placed Arien Jorise; but 
in 1629, the company abandoned sending set- 
tlers because of the heavy expense. 

The Dutch W^est India Co. having aban- 
doned the settlement policy, adopts the plan of 
allowing manorial grants, which is approved 
by the Lords States-General at Amsterdam, 
June 7, 1629. Kiliaen \'an Rensselaer, Direc- 
tor of the Amsterdam Chamber and wealthy 
pearl merchant of that city, obtained on No- 
vember 19. 1629, the first concession to estab- 
lish a colony. He wrote at once to Sebastiaen 
Jansen Crol, at Fort Orange, to purchase a 
tract from the Mohawk Indians for him and 
his associates. The first lot of colonists sailed 
on The Unity (de Eendrach) Captain Jan 
Brouwer commanding, March 21, 1630. On 
July 27, 1630, Crol bought the tract on which 
.Albany is built, extending it southward by 
purchases along the west shore from Beeren 
to Smacks Island, .April 30. 1631. The Unity 
reached Manhattan Island May 24, 1630. and 
arrived at Fort Orange June ist. The deed 
of the Indians, dated August 13, 1630, trans- 
ferred the land on which Albany is built to 
Kiliaen \'an Rensselaer, and in 163 1 he 
formed a partnership with a limited number 
of Hollanders, who eventually withdrew their 
interest in the land. Jan Baptist Van Rensse- 
laer was the first of the family to come to 
this country, arriving- in 165 1, and became

Fort Crailo ( VankL-e Doodle house), erected by Ilen- 
drick Van Rensselaer, at Greenbnsh. opposite Albany. 

"Director" of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, 
May 8, 1652. He was the seventh child of 
Kiliaen, and never was the Patroon. The 
second Patroon was Kiliacn's second child, 
Johannes, never came to this country, and 
died in 1662 or 1663. The third Patroon was 
Jeremias Van Rensselaer, eighth child of 
Kiliaen. and he came to America to take up 
his residence in the Manor, marrying at New 
Amsterdam, July 12. 1662, Maria \'an Cort- 
landt. 

The name Beverwyck came into use when 
Director-General Pieter Stuyvesant. chief 
official for the Dutch West India Co. in New 
Netherland, with headquarters on Manhattan 
Island, visited Fort Orange on April i, 1652, 
and proclaimed that the land built up about 
the fort be known as Dorpe Beverwyck. 

The name .Albany came into use for the first 
time -on September 24, 1664. The English 
had coveted New Netherland, claiming it as 
a portion of the territory granted by Queen 
Elizabeth in 1584 to Sir Walter Raleigh, and 
also of right by the discovery of the Cabots 
in 1497. The Plymouth Colony had grown 
jealous, and influenced King Charles II., of 
England, who made a grant of the territory 
embraced in New Netherland (and more be- 
sides) to his brother, James, Duke of York 
and Albany, on March 12, 1664. The English 
fleet entered New York Bay August 26th, and 
its commander, Colonel Richard NicoUs, de- 
manded of Director-General Stuyvesant that 
he surrender New Amsterdam. He made re- 
sistance as best he could ; but signed the capi- 
tulation September 8, 1664, and Vice-Director 
La Montague, for the Dutch West India Co. 
at Fort Orange, peacefully changed to the 
English rule, September 24, 1664. 

But the name Albany was to give way in 
succession to Willemstadt. This it did on 
.August 5. 1673. King Charles II., of Eng- 
land, broke the peace of Breda (July 31, 



1667), by declaring war on March 17, 1672, 
against Dutch provinces. A Dutch fleet of 
twenty-three vessels, with si.xteen hundred 
men aboard, entered New York Bay on July 
-9j 1673, and demanded the surrender of 
Fort James. It was not many hours later that 
day that it complietl, and when the news had 
time to travel to .Albany, Lieutenant Salisbury 
concluded that Fori Albany was properly once 
more under -the Dutch rule, so he acquiesced 
on August 5, 1673, and the place, to the south 
of Rensselaerswyck colony became known then 
as Willemstadt. 

This change to Dutch rule did not endure 
a decade, for when the treaty of Westminster 
was signed, whereby the Dutch stipulated on 
February 19, 1674, that all lands, islands, 
cities and forts that they had captured from 
the English should revert to that nation, there 
was nothing else for the inhabitants of Wil- 
lemstadt to do except conclude they were in- 
cluded within British territory, and the place 
was once more known as Albany. .\lx)ut a 
dozen years later, or July 22, 1686, Dongan 
granted the charter making Albany an incor- 
porated city. 

Pieter Schuyler, by the terms of the charter, 
became the first mayor. Thereafter the exe- 
cutive was appointed by the governor of the 
Colony of New York until after the Revolu- 
tion, when the Common Council voted for 
mayor; but the charter election held May 5, 
1840, inaugurated the election of that official 
by the people. 

The city of Albany is located on the west 
bank of the Hudson River, about 142 miles 
north of New York City, along which river 
it extends for three or four miles, and its 
east and west direction is about the same. 

The latitude of .Albany is 42°. 39', 13" 




Dutch Church in Beverwyck (Albany). 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



North. Its longitude is 73°, 46', 42" West 
of Greenwich, or 3', 17', 15" East of Wash- 
ington, and is but a fraction east of New York 
City. In time, Albany is 4 hours 55 minutes 
6.8 seconds later than Greenwich, or 13 min- 
utes 9 seconds earlier than Washington, and 
about 46.8 seconds earlier than New York- 
City. 

The river at Albany is only 2.6 feet above 
sea level, while the highest street elevation 
is 230 feet above this. The depth of channel 
permits vessels drawing 12 feet of water to 
dock there. It also has the mercantile advan- 
tage of two canals and five or more of the 
large steam railroads. The average date of 
opening of the river is March 17th, and the 
average closing date December i6th, making 
an average closed season of 90 days. 

The average yearly temperature, based on 
government records for 30 years, is 48'. The 
highest temperature ever recorded there was 
100'' on July 3, 1898, and the coldest, minus 
24°. on January 5, 1904. The average annual 
precipitation is 36.9 inches. 

The population was 100,253 by the United 
States Census of 1910. 

Berne. — This town was formed March 17, 
1795, from Rensselaerville, and from it Knox 
was taken off in 1822. It derived its name 
from Berne in Switzerland, the native place 
of Jacob Weidman, one of the first to locate 
there. an<l was settled largely by Germans, 
who leased farms from Patroon Van Rens- 
selaer, beginning about 1750. Many of 
Scotch descent arrived during the Revolu- 
tionary period. It is the central of the 
three western towns of the county, and is 
bounded on the north by Knox, on the east 
by New Scotland, on the south by Westerlo 
and Rensselaerville, and on the west by 
Schoharie county. The Helderberg moun- 
tains, rising 1,200 feet above tide, extend 
along its eastern border. Berneville itself 
was once known as Beaver Dam, and was a 
stockadoed town. Area : 38,782 acres. Popu- 
lation. 1910 Census: 1,753. 

Bethlehem. — This town was formed March 
12, 1793, and from it New Scotland was taken 
off April 25, 1832, and the eastern part of Al- 
bany city on April 6, 1870. It was purposely 
given its Biblical name. It lies on the bank of 
the Hudson, east of the center of the county, 
and includes all islands west of the main chan- 
nel, and is bounded on the north by Albany city, 
on the east by the Hudson river, on the south 
by Coeymans, and on the west by New Scot- 
land. One of the islands was known as Castle 
Island, and it is believed that it was the site 
of tlie first settlement in the entire county, 
or rather, that it was the site of a fort or 



trading-post built thereon by Dutch fur-trad- 
ers under Skipper Corstiaensen, in 1614: but 
removed in 1617 further inland because of 
dangerous freshets in the spring. This island, 
of some size, was later known as Westerlo, 
and then as Van Rensselaer. It was settled 
by the farmer tenants of Patroon Van Rensse- 
laer in 1630. Through it flows the Normans 
kil, a name derived from Albert Andriessen 
Bradt de Noorman, lessee of the land about 
the falls for mill purposes at a very early date. 
Area: 31.549 acres. Population, 1910 Census: 
4,413- " 

Coeymans. — This town was formed March 
18, 1791, from Watervliet. It was included in 
the grant to Van Rensselaer for the tract ex- 
tending from Beeren Island northward to Co- 
hoes ; but quit-claimed in 1706 by him to Pieter 
Coeymans, who settled thereon in 1636. as a 
miller, and confirmed by Queen Anne, August 
6, 1714. A portion was taken oft" for Westerlo 
in 1815. Its name was derived from the paten- 
tee. It is the southeast corner town in the coun- 
ty, including adjacent islands, and is bounded 
on the north by Bethlehem, on the west by 
Westerlo, on the south by Greene county, and 
on the east by the Hudson river. Through it 
flow the precipitous Coeymans and Haanakrois 
creeks, the Indian name of the former having 
been Oniskethau, and in the village of Coey- 
mans the falls have a drop of seventy-five 
feet. Area : 30,408 acres. Population, 1910 
Census : 4.252. 

CoHOES. — This city was formed from 
Watervliet, and was incorporated May 19, 
1869; previously, since April 12, 1855, it had 
been an incorporated village of Watervliet. 
The name is of Indian derivation, Gahaoose, 
signifying canoe falling, or overshoot. Area, 
1,575 acres. Population, i9io"Census: First 
ward. 5,371; Second, 4,202; Third. 4,014; 
I-'ourth, 5.097; Fifth, 3,011: Sixth, 3,014; 
Total. 24,709. 

CoLONiK. — TIlis was once an incorporated 
town and village : but due to changes in for- 
mation of townships passed out of existence. 
Originally the term was applied to all the col- 
onized territory of Rcnsselaerswyck ; but later 
was limited to that portion lying outside of 
and to the north of -Mbany city: and for a 
long time its southern boundary was Patroon 
street, now Clinton avenue in .\lbany city, 
which was north of the stockades when they 
extended east and west a little north of the 
present Orange and Van Tromp streets. 
\\'hen Watervliet was formed, in 1788, Col- 
onie became a part of it, and the indef- 
inite area extended to the south so as to 
include Tivoli Hollow fthrough which the 
N. Y. Central railroad runs on its route to

r.iittaltil. wlurc the Patroons had their flour 
and sa\v-!iiills. as well as the Manor House, 
his agent's pretentious office, etc. It was set 
apart as a district. .March 31, 1791, and again, 
by an additional .\ct, March 30, 1801. On 
April 9, 1804. it was incorporated as a village 
in the town of Watervliet, and organized as a 
separate towm, .\pril 11. 1808. February 25, 
181 5, it was divided and its legal existence ter- 
minated, by giving its territory to Albany city 
and Watervliet, the former portion becoming 
the old-time Fifth ward of Albany. On the 
last date mentioned, it had a population of 
i>657. 

Gl'iij)eri-\nd. — 1 his town was formed Fcl> 
ruary 26, 1803. from Watervliet. The name was 
derived from Guilderlandt in the Netherlands, 
w'hence had come many of its original settlers. 
The northwest portion of Albany city was an- 
nexed to this town, February 26, 1871. It 
is bounded on the north by Schenectady coun- 
ty, on the east by Watervliet and .Mbany, on 
the south by Bethlehem and New Scotland, 
and on the west by Knox. Area : 38,784 acres. 
Population. 1910 Census: 3,333, including 
Altamont village, with 674. 

Knox. — This town was formed Febru- 
ary 28, 7822, from Berne. The name was 
derived from John Knox, eminent divine 
and Scotland's reformer. It is situated 
in the northwest corner of the county, 
and is bounded on the north by Schenectady 
county, on the east by Guilderland, on the 
south by Berne, and on the west by Schoharie 
county. The inhabitants forcibly resisted the 
posse comitatis in the anti-rent feud of 1839, 
when Van Rensselaer sought to collect rentals 
under the peculiar leases. .Area : 26.402 acres. 
Population. 1910 Census: 1,007. 

New^ Scotland. — This town was formed 
April 25, 1832, from Bethlehem. It derived 
its name through the location there of a great 
number of settlers from Scotland. The first 
settler was Teunis Slingerland. a Hollander, 
who Ixiught 9,874 acres there from the In- 
dians, and erected mills. It is the central 
town of the county, and is bounded on the 
north by Guilderland, on the east by Bethle- 
hem, on the south by Coeymans and Westerlo, 
and on the west by Westerlo, Berne and Knox. 
Area: 34,324 acres. Population, 1910 Cen- 
sus : 2.834, including Yoorheesville, with 553. 

Rf.ns.sei-akrvimj;. — This town was formed 
March 8, 1790. Berne was taken off March 
17, 1795, and the western part of Westerlo on 
Afarch 16, 18 15. It is the southwestern cor- 
ner tow-n of the county, and is bounded on the 
north by Berne, on the east by Westerlo, on 
the south by Greene county, and on the west 
by Schoharie county. It was named in honor 



I if (icn. Stephen Van Rensselaer, or for his 
family. .Area: 37,354 acres. Population, 1910 
Census: 1,609. 

W.VTERVLiKT. — This town was formed March 
7, 1788, and was the first incorporated town in 
.\lbany county, and it then included all of 
West Rensselaerswyck, and all of the present 
county excepting Albany city, as it was at the 
time of the Charter, in 1686. Its name is 
from the Dutch, signifying "water flood," as 
it was situated principally along the flats be- 
tween the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, and 
large areas of it werp inundated each spring. 
This caused the soil to be unusually rich, and 
it was consequently early settled upon. In 
1809, Niskayuna, now in Schenectady county, 
was formed largely from it. Villages in it 
were incorporated as follows. ' Watervliet, 
March 30, 1801, changed to Colonie, April 9, 
1804 : became obsolete and was annexed to 
.Albany city; Gibbonsville, April 23, 1824; 
changed to West Troy, April 30, 1836; Co- 
hoes, incorporated April 12, 1855: changed to 
city of that name, May 19, 1869 : Green Island, 
387 acres, incorporated April 5, 1853. Within 
its limits are also Newtonville. named for John 
M. Newton, four miles north of .Albany; Lou- 
donville, at the same distance to the north of 
Albany ; Menands, named after its first set- 
tler, Louis Menand. two miles north of Al- 
bany. It surrendered a large tract (105 acres) 
to the Federal authorities by the cession laws 
of 1830 and 1833, conditionally "for the pur- 
pose of erecting and maintaining thereon ar- 
senals, magazines, dockyards and other neces- 
sary buildings," the first of which was erected 
thereon in 1814, under Col. Geo. I^urnford. 
The Albany Rural Cemetery Association se- 
cured a large tract, about one mile long in its 
shortest direction, chartered April 2, 1841, and 
adjacent tracts were secured by St. Agnes' 
and the .Anshe Emeth cemeteries. The State 
Fair Grounds occupied a large tract therein 
for years, until removed to Syracuse, and the 
Shakers established a settlement, or commu- 
nity, in 1776, under leadership of Mother Ann, 
a native of Manchester, Fng., who died there, 
September 8. 1784. Later changed name to 
Colonie. Area: 30.697 acres. Population, 
1910 Census: 8,385. 

Watkkvliet. — Incorporated as a city on 
May 26, 1896. Population. 1910 Census: First 
Ward. 1,936; Second, 1,326; Third. 1,283; 
Fourth, 1,737; Fifth, 1,582; Sixth, 1,603; 
Seventh, 1,804; Eighth. 1,944; Ninth, 1,859. 
Total, 15,074. 

Westerlo. — This town was formed March 
16. 1815, from Coeymans and Rensselaer- 
ville. It was named in honor of Dominie 
Filanlus Westerlo, wlio married Catherine

PROGENITORS OR EARLIEST SETTLERS 
OF ALBANY COUNTY. 



Interest that is taken in the history of a 
country or in a family centers largely in the 
facts relating to the origin. The person who 
studies either desires accurate and compre- 
hensive information, and that means the 
names of the chief characters, together with 
definite dates and facts about their lives and 
where they were located. This is the perfectly 
natural scope, and it is as definite in its way 
as is any of the sciences. 

The person concerned with understanding 
particulars about his or her family is led on, 
generation by generation, each with its own 
wealth or paucity of detail, until it becomes 
more desirable than all else to learn as much 
as possible about the Progenitor, or founder 
of the family in .America. 

The accompanying list has been prepared as 
an enutneration of those first persons who set- 
tled in .\lbany or vicinity previous to the year 
1700. It is practically a list of the heads of fam- 
ilies founding Albany city and the entire coun- 
ty. It does not pretend to deal with the descent ; 
but in those instances where two of the same 
surname, unrelated, were earliest settlers, both 
are given equal mention, for each started an 
independent line. The names of brothers are 
also treated, for the same reason, — each the 
"arriving" head of a family. .Accordingly, 
this not being a series of genealogies of fam- 
ilies, it has not been the aim to include facts 
relating to the issue of the founders, except 
to the extent of being in some instances proof 
of residence in the county before the year 
1700, if it is found that the baptism of his 
child was recorded, which may be the only 
clue to the fact of his early residence. 

It is well to speak of the scope or extent 
of this list in its usefulness. Most likely it 
shows the names of a great proportion of the 
different families who lived within a radius 
of one hundred miles of the city of .-Mbany 
during the first one htmdred years of this 
country's existence, and therefore the research 



is decidedly extensive. It should be decidedly 
heli)ful to any person seeking information 
about a Progenitor in tlie section of the coun- 
try covered. This may be explained more 
clearly by calling to mind that nearly all the 
people who lived in early times at the few 
places of settlement, such as Schenectady, 
Kinderhook, Amsterdam, Coeymans, Coxsac- 
kie, Catskill, Hudson, Claverack. Esopus, 
.Amsterdam, and a few other localities, settled 
first at Albany, and then removed as it suited 
their inclination. 

There are other reasons giving this list even 
broader significance. It has its interest even 
in New York City, to a large extent, without 
giving thought to the ever constant shifting 
of family location. Those families arriving in 
this country by way of New .Amsterdam quite 
frequently remained there a time, establishing 
relationships before moving up the river. It 
was often the case that the newly-arrived 
youth took to himself a bride in Manhattan 
before desiring to risk adventure in an un- 
known kind of territory. Frequently fam- 
ilies would divide on landing, certain mem- 
bers remaining on the island, others prefer- 
ring to seek their fortune in the new colony 
of Rensselaerswyck. There were so few other 
localities whither a young man in either place 
might turn to find a bride, previous to 1700, 
that the intermarriages were of common oc- 
currence. 

The list might have suited a greater num- 
ber of persons the better by shifting the date 
of limitation to the year 1750; but that would 
have made it voluminous. As it is, the names 
of more than 450 distinct families are ade- 
quately mentioned as progenitors before 1700. 
Those who are surprised that they do not 
find their family name in the list should seek 
it in the list of .Albany County Freeholders of 
1720, or in the 1790 U. S. Census of "Heads 
of I'amilies." 

To avoid semblance of conceit, it might be 



HUDSON AXD MOHAWK VALLEYS 



stated that with the application of from ten 
to twenty years devoted to the work, a dili- 
gent compiler could render excellent service 
to a large circle of genealogists by confining a 
volume to the subject, giving full biographies 
of each subject. Such a work should include 
the names of children of the progenitor, and 
would make a book of about five hundred 
pages limited solely to the Albany settlers, for 
it is not claimed that herewith are all the 
facts commonly known about these men. With 
the records carefully sifted, a page to each 
name would be an ordinary average, for what 
genealogist would not welcome an entire page 
filled with' the data on his progenitor. 

It is not claimed that the material comprised 
in this list has not been known in its several 
parts to some one previously, or that it cannot 
be discovered in the same manner as was the 
case when this list was specially prepared. 
But it has never been gathered as in this 
arrangement for reference, because it com- 
bines all the material in a number of works, 
and it is decidedly superior to anything like 
it. This can be maintained because it has 
those revisions or corrections suggested by 
following closely the information provided by 
the most excellent recent work of the New 
York State Archivist, .Arnold ]. F. van Laer, 
when translating with exceeding care and na- 
tive skill the documents of Patroon Kiliaen 
Van Rensselaer, preserved still in Holland, 
from which one gains much information re- 
garding when the colonist sailed, and specifi- 
cally, by the contract, learn definitely regard- 
ing his occupation. 

It is doubtful whether there is any family 
line more difficult to understand, or trace, 
than the Dutch. The pioneers in this par- 
ticular well deserve abundant credit. It is 
highly desirable for one to be an expert, or 
else leave it strictly alone. Every muddler 
creates more havoc for others to puzzle upon 
and untangle. 

Pointing out a few of the simplest forms 
of error may be a warning to others The 
novices and not infre(|uently the printer, quite 
commonly misinterpret the old form bouwcric, 
or bowery, for brewer. It is surprising to find 
it so often stated "he owned a brewery," when 
it is meant the person had a farm or home- 
stead. Some persons in an attemjit to an- 
glicize the Dutch names fall into error 
through ignorance. They misconstrue a name 
such as Jacobus to mean Jacob, not realizing 
that it means James, and they imagine the 
Dutch family name Jacobs to be Hebraic, 
whereas it signified in those early days a con- 
traction of Jacobse or Jacobsen, meaning a per- 
son who was the son of Jacob. Novices should 



be wary regarding the literal significance of 
Dutch measures, for many in their writing 
family descents have overlooked the fact that 
possibly the original statement was in Rhine- 
land measure. 

A large majority of the early Dutch set- 
tlers spelled their own names indiiiferentlv, 
that is, in a number of ways, possibly a dozen, 
when a man had an alias. Clerks would enter 
them on the records each according to his idea 
of phonetic spelling, and while we may not 
blame then:, we are bothered. Often the per- 
son who was a lowly emigrant could not be 
of much assistance in elucidating. Hence, 
it is difficult to make a list that shall be read- 
able like a directory. 

The classification of names of the first set- 
tlers of Albany is a most difficult task even 
for the most .skilled. The expert is non- 
plussed, for he is forced to make statements 
which show it. When a large percentage of 
the colonists signed contracts with Patroon 
Kiliaen \'an Rensselaer in Amsterdam, to go 
to his colony in .America, they frequently 
signed simply their Christian name. It was 
all by which the\- were known. If he was 
named John, or in their language Johannes 
or Jan, he could be distinguished in a few 
primordial ways from any other Jan. If his 
father were named Pieter, they called him 
'■John, the son of Pieter," or "Jan Pieterse." 
If he hved at some pecuHar location, as on a 
hill, he might be called "John from the Hill," 
or "Jan van den Berg," and again, if from a 
city, it would be associated with his name, 
and the John who lived in Vechten would be 
known to his fellow-men as Jan Van Vechten. 
Often his trade would suggest his future sur- 
name, and "John, the baker." would write his 
name "Jan Backer." In one case a colonist 
named Jan with a father named Pieter, after 
he had built a mill for the Patroon, was 
known as Jan Pieterse Meulenmaecker. A 
young fellow might have his name written in 
the contract "Jan Pieterse Jonger." Given 
such a mixture, of one set of names when they 
resided in Holland, and known by an alias 
after living in this country, it is a problem 
to distinguish father and children of the same 
family, but passing under diflferent names. 
The man named Jan Pietersen might have 
sons signing their names Jan Backer, Hen- 
drick Van Vechten, Pieter Meulenmaecker, 
Arent van den Berg. 

It merits attention that throughout the first 
one hundred years of .Albany's history, true 
of the city and possibly so about the county, 
there was hardly a person living in that re- 
gie m who was not a Dutchman. Let the 
doubter dissect the following list most care- 



HUDSON AND MOHAWK VALLEYS 



fully, and those of other nationality than Hol- 
lander can be counted on the finsjers of one 
iiand. It is true that New Ln^land was prac- 
tically Cdiiteniporanei >u:^ in settlement, yet the 



English did not intermarry with the Dutch, 
at least not in Albany, before the year 1700.

HUDSON AND MOHAWK \ALLEYS 



Jansen. — This name is equivalent to John- 
son, or "son of John." It appears written 
"Ian" with any sort of a fanciful pen scroll fol- 
lowing the last letter, in order to indicate 
"Jan, son of Jan," and simply another form 
of Johannes, or contraction of it. It is tliere- 
fore possible to write out this scroll, indica- 
tive of possession, as Jans, Janse, or Jansen. 
It may be more clearly understood by remem- 
bering that the English, in olden times, wrote 
"John his book," which became after a while 
the custom to write "John's book." Doubt- 
less many have desired to know in what form 
to write the name which has often appeared 
as "Anneke Jansen," so as to follow her own 
form ; but one could simply write "Ian" or 
"Jan," and follow it with a flourish. The 
following names appear variously as Jans, 
Janse and Jansen on the old records ; but it 
would be correct to treat them all as "Jan- 
sen." In any event, it would merely depend 
on which particular signature is selected, for 
the same man wrote it differently at various 
times. Adriaen Jansen was schoolmaster, ap-

Blaisdell, p. 796, 2d col. ; a son, Thomas Houghtahng. was horn to Robert V. B. and Marguerite V. 
(Briggs) Blaisdell, November 3, 1910. 

Bovie, p. 969; in this narrative the name Hoosac is preserved. The ancient spelling was Hoosac, or 
Hoosack, an Indian word meaning Owl Valley, but when the town was incorporated, for some unaccountable 
reason the spelling was changed to Hoosick, which means nothing. Every name is Hoosac across the state 
line m Massachusetts — Hoosac Tunnel, Hoosac Mountain, Hoosac River, etc. Mr. George M. Bovie"s 
first school attendance was in Hoosac, New York, not Vermont. 

Boyd, p. 444, 2d col. ; John Logan Boyd, or John Jr., as he was usually called (eldest child of John

a millwright and farmer in Ballston, now Charlton, Saratoga county. Was first supervisor of Charlton, 
1791, and later a justice of the peace; was therefore of good standing and repute. In politics he was 
undoubtedly a moderate Royalist, or "Tory" ; was once arrested on suspicion, by the commissioner of con- 
spiracies of .Albany county, and his father was one of his bondsmen in the sum of i200. He was driven 
from home, however, by Burgoyne's approach, and with his neighbors petitioned the authorities for better 
military protection. He married Anna Northrop, March 25, 1779. They had twelve children, ten of whom 
were born in Charlton, one, Polly, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, 1782, and the youngest child was born 
in Newark, now Niagara, Ontario, Canada, to which place the family removed about 1799; there they prob- 
ably died and were buried.
